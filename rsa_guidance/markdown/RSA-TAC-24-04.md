SUBJECT:       Requirements and Considerations for the Provision of Out-of-State
## Services for the Benefit of VR Program Recipients

# PURPOSE:

The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) within the U.S. Department of Education’s
Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services has received inquiries requesting
clarification regarding whether State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies may support the
choice of recipients of VR services to attend out-of-State postsecondary training, including
programs that provide disability-specific supports, training, or accommodations. RSA issues this
technical assistance circular (TAC) to clarify State VR agencies’ responsibilities and the role that

State VR agencies may play in supporting informed choice for recipients of VR services,
including postsecondary education, and providing out-of-State services that meet their
individualized needs in accordance with their signed Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE).
By optimizing flexibility in policies and maximizing investments in the provision of high-quality
training and services best suited to the needs and available options open to recipients of VR
services, State VR agencies can promote sustained engagement and greater participant
satisfaction and maximize quality services leading to the achievement of competitive integrated
employment, independence, and self-sufficiency.

## Requirements

## Informed Choice and Nature and Scope of Services

Under Section 102(b)(3)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) —

“An [IPE] shall be developed and implemented in a manner that affords eligible individuals
the opportunity to exercise informed choice in selecting an employment outcome, the
specific vocational rehabilitation services to be provided under the plan, the entity that will
provide the vocational rehabilitation services, and the methods used to procure the
services…”

In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.50(a), VR agencies must develop and maintain written
policies covering the nature and scope of each of the VR services specified in 34 C.F.R. §
361.48(b) and the criteria under which each service is provided. While not establishing any
arbitrary limits on the nature and scope of VR services to be provided to the individual, the
policies must—

- • Ensure that the provision of services is based on the rehabilitation needs of each
individual as identified in that individual's IPE; and
- • Be consistent with the individual's informed choice.

With respect to out-of-State services, State VR agencies may establish a preference for in-State
services, so long as the preference does not effectively deny an individual a necessary service
that may be available out-of-State.1 State VR agencies may not establish policies that effectively

prohibit the provision of out-of-State services.

## Costs and Rates of Payment

If a VR recipient chooses an out-of-State service at a higher cost than an in-State service, if
either service would meet the individual's rehabilitation needs, State VR agencies are not
responsible for those costs in excess of the cost of the in-State service (34 C.F.R. §
361.50(b)(1)). However, when an in-State service would not meet an individual’s rehabilitation
needs in the same way that an out-of-State service would, there is nothing in the Rehabilitation
Act or its VR program regulations to prohibit the VR agency from incurring the additional costs;
in fact, 34 C.F.R. § 361.50(b)(2) prohibits the VR agency from adopting policies that effectively
deny the provision of out-of-State services. Furthermore, a State VR agency may not apply
financial needs tests or require participation in the cost of VR services as a condition for
providing VR services of any kind, including out-of-State services, to individuals with
disabilities determined eligible for Social Security benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social
## Security Act (34 C.F.R. § 361.54(b)(3)(ii)).


Finally, under 34 C.F.R. § 361.50(c), State VR agencies must establish and maintain written
policies to govern the rates of payment for all purchased VR services. These policies may
include rates of payment for postsecondary or other programs that provide disability-specific
supports or training. In establishing a fee schedule designed to ensure a reasonable cost to the
program for each service, State VR agencies must ensure that the schedule is not so low as to
effectively deny an individual a necessary service. In addition, the fee schedule must permit
exceptions so that an individual’s needs can be addressed. State VR agencies may not place
absolute dollar limits on specific service categories or on the total services provided to an
eligible individual.

## Considerations

State VR agencies should exercise flexibility related to the provision of out-of-State services to
address the unique needs of the individuals with disabilities they serve, including students with
disabilities, when implementing the above statutory and regulatory provisions on informed

choice, nature and scope of services, and the costs and rates of payment for services. Many
compelling reasons exist for providing out-of-State services to recipients of VR services so that
they can maximize every opportunity to achieve high quality employment. The following
paragraphs illustrate some of the disability and vocational needs State VR agencies should
consider to best support individuals with disabilities to achieve competitive integrated
employment, in part, through the provision of out-of-State services.

While State VR agencies may establish a preference for in-State services, in accordance with 34
C.F.R. § 361.50(b)(1) there may be instances when an in-State service would not meet an
individual’s disability needs in the same way as an out-of-State service. For example, some

1 34 C.F.R. § 361.50(b)(1).

postsecondary educational institutions have specialized programs to meet the disability needs of
VR participants. Though in-State postsecondary programs serving the general student population
may meet certain of these disability needs, they may or may not meet all the individualized needs
of a VR participant. When the identified disability needs of the individual cannot be met
effectively through an in-State program, State VR agencies may support an individual in an out-
of-State program, even at an additional cost because there is no prohibition in either the
Rehabilitation Act or its VR program regulations against doing so. Out-of-State services may
include postsecondary institutions designed to provide barrier-free environments for individuals
who are deaf, consistent with their communication preferences, or programs designed to address

the specific needs of disability groups (e.g., individuals with autism, learning disabilities, or
intellectual disabilities) in ways that are not available from in-State postsecondary education
programs. Other examples of disability-specific training programs include rehabilitation centers
for individuals who are DeafBlind or orientation and adjustment centers for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired.

Some out-of-State programs offer pre-employment transition services to students with
disabilities with unique disability needs. For example, if a student has specific disability-related
needs when participating in required pre-employment transition services that can be addressed
best in an environment that supports those needs in an out-of-State program (e.g., residential
training centers for individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or DeafBlind), or that are
available at a time when in-State services may not be available (e.g., summer months), then State
VR agencies may consider providing those services along with allowable services needed to
access the pre-employment transition services identified on an IPE for VR eligible students with
disabilities using funds reserved for pre-employment transition services.


In addition, State VR agencies should consider the individual’s unique vocational needs when
developing the IPE and determining if out-of-State services best meet those needs because VR
services must be provided in accordance with the individual’s signed and approved IPE as
described in 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.45 and 361.46. If a VR participant’s course of study or degree
needed to meet the employment goal specified on the IPE is not available in an in-State
postsecondary program or institution of higher education, then the VR agency must consider out-
of-State alternatives if that is the only methodology for providing VR services to achieve the
employment outcome agreed by both the eligible individual and the VR counselor on the signed
and approved IPE in accordance with 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.45 and 361.46upon. For example, if no
in-State institution of higher education offers an academic course of study or degree needed to
meet an individual’s employment goal identified on the signed and approved IPE, such as a
specialized pharmaceutical degree meeting recognized accreditation standards, or an advanced
degree such as a doctorate degree in a new and emerging field like regenerative medicine, then
State VR agencies must support an individual at an out-of-State postsecondary institution since
that is the only service that will enable the individual to achieve the agreed-upon employment
outcome. In addition, the quality of a reputable program offered out-of-State may better position

the individual for the successful achievement of employment. If a VR participant has been
accepted into a prestigious out-of-State college or university that is recognized as a recruitment
source for positions in renowned industries or businesses that offer high quality employment and
career pathways, then State VR agencies should support a participant’s choice to attend such an
institution.

The benefits of out-of-State services for individuals with disabilities may outweigh the financial
impacts of any additional costs associated with these services. When determining the costs of in-
State verses out-of-State programs, State VR agencies should consider all costs required to
support a recipient of VR services in the program. For example, in some instances, supporting an
individual with a disability in an in-State postsecondary institution serving the general student

population may involve additional expenses related to the individual’s access or disability-
related needs (e.g., sign language interpreter, personal attendant services, and college programs
for students with autism). Similarly, if an out-of-State training program offers services that are
uniquely suited to the VR participant’s disability needs (e.g., an orientation and adjustment
program for individuals who are blind or DeafBlind) or are not available consistent with an
individual’s choice or identified needs in an in-State environment, then, State VR agencies may
support the individual in an out-of-State training program, which may or may not require an
additional expense.


State VR agencies’ policies should provide ample flexibility to fully meet recipients’ disability
needs and required supports. For instance, establishing a policy requiring an individual to first
earn a degree at a two-year community college and then complete a bachelor’s degree through a
transfer to a four-year institution could create unnecessary burden for the individual. As an
example, this policy may require the individual to re-establish necessary supports, especially if
an out-of-State alternative exists where the individual could complete a bachelor’s degree at a
single institution.

Additionally, State VR agencies should consider including reasonable costs associated with an
individual’s participation in out-of-State services such as the cost of transportation. For example,
if a student attends an out-of-State college, it would likely be reasonable to provide
transportation costs to and from the college, including those associated with scheduled semester
or quarter breaks.

State VR agencies also should consider collaborating with State VR agencies in other States
when providing individuals out-of-State services, given that it is allowable for State VR agencies

in different States to simultaneously provide VR services to eligible individuals under respective
IPEs (see RSA-TAC-12-04). For example, the need for such collaboration can arise when an
individual receives financial assistance from the State VR agency in the State where they reside
to attend a postsecondary education institution in another State. While attending the college or
university, the individual may require other services, including, but not limited to, orientation
and mobility training, assistive technology devices and training in their use, reader or interpreter
services, and personal assistance services. In cases where such additional services are necessary,
the State VR agency located in the State where the individual is attending college is often in
closest proximity to the individual and possesses the knowledge of the sources available in the
State to provide such services. Thus, it is this State VR agency that is in the best position to
deliver the effective and timely services that will enhance the individual’s educational
experience, better enabling them to achieve an employment outcome.

Finally, State VR agencies should inform individuals with disabilities of their due process rights
as described in Section 102(c) of the Rehabilitation Act and the availability of services from the
Client Assistance Program under Section 112 if the individual and the VR agency are in dispute

over the services to be provided, including the provision of out-of-State services.


# SUMMARY:

Because the signed and approved IPE is the vehicle through which all VR services are provided,
including out-of-State services, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.45 and 361.46, State VR
agencies should provide VR services that best meet the unique disability and vocational needs of
individuals with disabilities and maximize employment opportunities for such individuals, even
if those services are located out-of-State. State VR agencies have flexibility to implement
policies that take into account informed choice and individualized VR service needs of those

they serve when providing VR services and supports to recipients choosing out-of-State
postsecondary education and occupational training or disability-related training programs.
Additionally, students with disabilities may benefit from the receipt of out-of-State pre-
employment transition services, as appropriate. Supporting specialized out-of-State services and
programs can be done in collaboration with other State VR agencies and may make the critical
difference in an individual remaining engaged in the VR process and achieving high-quality
employment, self-sufficiency, and independence.
