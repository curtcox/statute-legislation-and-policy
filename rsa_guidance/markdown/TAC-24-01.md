SUBJECT:       Promoting Meaningful and Sustained Engagement of Individuals with
## Disabilities in the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program
# PURPOSE:

The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) provides this Technical Assistance Circular
- (TAC) to support State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies in their efforts to make changes
that will promote meaningful and sustained engagement with individuals with disabilities
throughout the VR process. The continuum of VR services affords VR agencies opportunities,
through multiple touchpoints, to provide quality services that maximize the potential of
individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to
achieve “competitive integrated employment,” as defined in Section 7(5) of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(9). By actively considering and

acknowledging the importance of sustained engagement that encourages and fosters active
participation of individuals with disabilities in services, VR agencies can improve performance,
reduce attrition of those they serve, and increase the number of participants achieving their
employment goal on their individualized plan for employment (IPE).

Through the identification and implementation of critical strategies and flexibilities, without
compromising the responsibilities of qualified VR counselors and staff at key points in the
process, VR agencies will afford the greatest likelihood of success and employment satisfaction
for both program participants and VR agency employees. Meaningful early and consistent
engagement practices will contribute to participant retention, timely provision of valuable and
needed services, participant satisfaction and long-term success, and could improve agency
performance. Additionally, meaningful engagement strategies likely will place State VR
agencies in a better position to maximize the expenditure of available Federal funds for VR
services, as well as for the provision of pre-employment transition services, thereby increasing
the likelihood of competitive integrated employment and supported employment outcomes,
including customized employment, for individuals with disabilities under the VR program.

RSA recognizes the multiple challenges faced by State VR agencies, including balancing quality
service delivery with staffing limitations, effectively serving both urban and rural areas, and
rebuilding performance and capacity of both agency staff and service providers lost during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This TAC lays out suggested methods and approaches to encourage,
inform, and inspire the development of strategies for optimizing VR program visibility, easing
application and eligibility processes, engaging eligible individuals awaiting services while in a
closed order of selection category, providing VR services leading to successful high-quality
employment outcomes, supporting the engagement of VR professionals in meaningful work that
will lead to participant and agency success, and recognizing and incentivizing VR program
successes and achievements.

# TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:


Meaningful and sustained engagement involves the ongoing cultivation of relationships,
supported by a culture that engages both employees and participants. The most effective way of
engaging individuals with disabilities throughout the VR process is by putting them first,
building trust in their relationships with VR counselors and staff, and adding extraordinary value
to their overall experiences and services. Simply providing basic service alone is no longer
enough to constitute meaningful engagement with the individual. RSA encourages VR agencies
to ensure that services not only meet but exceed the expectations and needs of individuals with
disabilities because the quality of VR participants’ experiences, i.e., the perception that
participants form based on their interactions with the VR agency and the services they receive,
has a direct impact on a VR agency’s potential for success with those participants.

## Optimizing VR Program Visibility

The VR program has been referred to among stakeholders, professionals, and public officials as a
“best-kept secret” far too long. Changing that reality means optimizing the visibility of State VR
agencies by marketing the program in accordance with the requirements in the Uniform

Guidance at 2 C.F.R. § 200.467 and regularly engaging in strategic actions to improve their
visibility to people who access their services. VR agencies can improve their visibility and invite
successful engagement through a variety of methods which could include—

- •  Spotlighting successes on VR agency websites and through community connections
with stakeholder groups;
- •  Providing a 24-hour open-door and high-quality service presence virtually online or
through social media, or by telephone;
- •  Featuring positive ratings and feedback from program participants and employers
through multiple media;
- •  Highlighting the value of services, agency performance, and the social and fiscal return
on investment when sharing information with public policymakers;

- •  Engaging public officials and legislators in personalizing and acknowledging the
achievements of program participants through congratulatory letters or similar
recognition activities;
- •  Establishing a virtual or physical presence in secondary and postsecondary educational
settings and in American Job Centers (AJCs);

- •  Promoting the broad continuum of available services from pre-employment transition
services for students with disabilities to employment advancement;
- •  Emphasizing on websites and in public information what the VR agency aspires to
accomplish along with the range and depth of available resources rather than featuring
limitations on services (e.g., order of selection, lack of fiscal resources, staff shortages);
and
- •  Introducing the wide array of available services to ensure individuals with disabilities
have access to information to make choices and inquire about specific resources to
support their pathway to the greatest possible employment success.


Optimizing the VR agency’s presence and visibility in the State can be done at minimal cost with
maximum effect that results in fulfilling the VR agency’s purpose and mission while
successfully engaging and serving individuals with disabilities and employers, thereby assisting
individuals with disabilities to achieve employment outcomes in high-demand and rewarding
careers in the competitive labor market.

## Engaging Early and Often

Students and youth with disabilities should be afforded multiple opportunities to connect and
engage with VR professionals who can provide services that can help to ensure the successful
transition from school to work life. VR professionals can provide access to an early start at job
exploration through transition and pre-employment transition services arranged in coordination
with educational agencies. VR professionals can also provide career counseling and information
and referral services to facilitate the successful transition from school to work life. Pre-
employment transition services, as described in 34 C.F.R. § 361.48(a), are the earliest set of
services available to individuals with disabilities under the VR program. These services,

provided in collaboration with local educational agencies (LEAs), are available to both
potentially eligible and eligible students with disabilities who meet the definition of a “student
with a disability” in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(51). A student can receive multiple and frequent pre-
employment transition services. Participation in these services can promote continued
engagement with the VR program and support the development of a meaningful and substantive
IPE, including the delivery of services leading to achievement of competitive integrated
employment.

The five required pre-employment transition services activities outlined in 34 C.F.R. §
361.48(a)(2) provide opportunities for early engagement of students with disabilities, regardless
of whether they have applied or been determined eligible for the VR program. They are—

- •  Job exploration counseling;
- •  Work-based learning experiences, which may include in-school or after school

opportunities, or experience outside the traditional school setting (including
internships), that is provided in an integrated environment in the community to the
maximum extent possible;
- •  Counseling on opportunities for enrollment in comprehensive transition or
postsecondary educational programs at institutions of higher education;
- •  Workplace readiness training to develop social skills and independent living; and

3

## Page 4







- •  Instruction in self-advocacy (including instruction in person-centered planning),
which may include peer mentoring (including peer mentoring from individuals with
disabilities working in competitive integrated employment).

When a VR agency is working with schools to coordinate and provide transition services or pre-
employment transition services to students with disabilities, including those students identified
for purposes of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the coordination of any VR services
should occur concurrently with transition planning and services under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Specifically, a VR agency should proactively seek
engagement with educational agencies to participate in individualized education program (IEP)
team meetings, when invited, to coordinate activities, provide consultation, and encourage

seamless access to the VR program (34 C.F.R. § 361.48(a)(4)(i) and (iii)).

Although the purpose of the VR program is to assist individuals with disabilities to achieve an
employment outcome in competitive integrated employment or supported employment, some
individuals with disabilities may choose to consider subminimum wage employment. Section
511 of the Rehabilitation Act imposes limitations on the payment of subminimum wage for a
“youth with a disability,” as defined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(58), seeking subminimum wage
employment. The requirements related to the roles and responsibilities of VR agencies and LEAs
are outlined in Section 511 of the Rehabilitation Act. Certain specific requirements, set forth in
## 34 C.F.R. § 397.20, must be fulfilled and documented prior to a youth with a disability receiving
a subminimum wage. The requirements support meaningful, sustained, and informed
engagement of youth with disabilities, affording opportunities for youth and their networks to
receive information regarding pre-employment transition services, as applicable, the opportunity
to apply for VR services, and, regardless of determination of eligibility, the receipt of career
counseling and information and referral services to local Federal and State programs that offer
employment-related services and supports. Career counseling and information and referral
services may include benefits counseling to assist youth with disabilities and their families in

understanding the interplay between earned income and income-based financial, medical, and
other benefits (34 C.F.R. § 397.40(a)(4)). While Section 511 of the Rehabilitation Act prescribes
minimum required contact intervals, more frequent contact can encourage greater engagement,
help to facilitate the VR program connection with youth with disabilities that otherwise might
not occur once a youth is hired at subminimum wage, and may foster further exploration of
available VR services, leading to the achievement of an employment outcome in competitive
integrated employment or supported employment.

## Expediting Application and Eligibility to Sustain Engagement

“If you build it, they will come” only works if people know about VR agencies and if VR
agencies offer the services people value and need. Increased visibility of VR agencies, coupled
with positive expectations and VR experiences, will inevitably lead to more referrals, applicants,
and potentially more eligible individuals with disabilities who could benefit from the VR
program.

## Streamlining Application - Initiating Engagement

Timely engagement of individuals during referral and application, essential at this early stage in
the VR process, is best achieved if VR agencies streamline procedures and remove any
unnecessary barriers and requirements. The Rehabilitation Act and the VR program regulations
require standards for the prompt and equitable handling of referrals of individuals for VR
services, including referrals of individuals made through the one-stop delivery system under
## Section 121 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which must include
timelines for making good faith efforts to inform individuals of application requirements and to
gather information necessary to begin an assessment for determining eligibility and priority for
services (34 C.F.R. § 361.41(a)). VR agencies should eliminate delays in the referral and
application process, thereby expediting engagement and facilitating rapid access to VR services.


VR agencies can simplify the application process and provide multiple avenues for individuals
with disabilities to apply, including by: telephone; completion of an online application;
submission of a written application form; or in person at multiple locations such as a local VR
agency office, an AJC or one-stop center, an employer location (including an entity holding a
certificate issued under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act), or a mutually convenient
location in the community such as a library or an individual’s home. Requiring applicants to
attend a scheduled group meeting to submit an application, while potentially more efficient for a
VR agency experiencing capacity and resource challenges, reduces the ease of applying for those
who may need transportation, accommodations, personal assistance arrangements, or who may
be otherwise inconvenienced or unable to participate in the group meetings. Such an approach
also can lengthen the application timeframe and unintentionally discourage some individuals
from applying, or cause others to disengage prematurely from the VR process.

In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.41(b)(2), an application has been made when an
individual—


- •  Has completed and signed an agency application form;
- •  Has completed a common intake application form in a one-stop center requesting VR
services; or
- •  Has otherwise requested services from the designated State unit (DSU).

Additionally, an individual is considered to have completed an application when the individual
or the individual's representative, as appropriate—

- •  Has provided the information necessary to initiate an assessment to determine eligibility
and priority for services, and
- •  Is available to complete the assessment process.


In general, unless specifically required by State statute or regulation, applicants should not be
required to provide unnecessary information or documentation during the application process,
such as proof of State residency, which can potentially deter applicants or prolong the
application and eligibility determination process. For example, VR agencies must assure in the
VR services portion of their Unified or Combined State Plan that they will not impose a duration

5

## Page 6







of residence requirement that excludes from services any applicant who is present in the State.
Thus, the VR agency may not require the applicant to demonstrate a presence in the State
through the production of any documentation that, under State or local law, or practical
circumstances, results in a de facto duration of residence requirement. Furthermore, in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(c), no applicant or group of applicants may be excluded or
found ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability; and eligibility requirements must be
applied without regard to the—

- •  Age, sex, race, color, or national origin of the applicant;
- •  Type of expected employment outcome;
- •  Source of referral for VR services;

- •  Particular service needs or anticipated cost of services required by an applicant or the
income level of an applicant or applicant's family;
- •  Applicants' employment history or current employment status; and
- •  Applicants' educational status or current educational credential.

In addition, while collecting information to determine financial need is allowable, it is not
required by the Rehabilitation Act and may lengthen the timeframe for eligibility determination
and development of the IPE, increasing the burden for the VR counselor as well as the applicant.

## Streamlining Determination of Eligibility - Expediting Engagement


Timely delivery of VR services begins with eligibility determinations. Eligibility must be
determined within 60 days unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the
control of the DSU and the DSU and applicant agree to a specific extension of time (34 C.F.R. §
361.4(b)), or an individual requires a trial work experience (34 C.F.R. § 361.42(e)). A DSU’s
determination of whether an individual with a disability is eligible for the VR program must be
based only on the following three criteria:

- •  Determination by qualified personnel that the applicant has a physical or mental
impairment (34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i));
- •  Determination by qualified personnel that the applicant’s physical or mental impairment
constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment (34 C.F.R.
§ 361.42(a)(1)(ii); and
- •  Determination by a qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU that the applicant

requires VR services to prepare for, obtain, maintain, advance in, or regain employment
that is consistent with the applicant’s unique strength, resources, priorities, concerns,
abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice (34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii)).

The Rehabilitation Act and its regulations create two distinct presumptions to assist in
streamlining the eligibility determination process, as appropriate. First, Section 102(a)(3) of the
Rehabilitation Act presumes that an applicant who has been determined to have a disability or to
be blind for purposes of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability
## Insurance (SSDI) must be:



6





---
## Page 7







- •  Considered to be a person with a significant disability, as defined at Section 7(21) of the
## Rehabilitation Act; and
- •  Presumed to be eligible for VR services (provided the applicant intends to achieve an
employment outcome) unless the qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU can
demonstrate that the applicant is incapable of benefitting from the VR program due to the
severity of the applicant’s disability.

The qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU can verify the applicant’s SSI or SSDI
determination in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.41(b)(2), after obtaining the applicant’s
informed consent, by obtaining the applicant’s SSI or SSDI award letter at the applicant’s “my

Social Security account” at the U.S. Social Security Administration. If an applicant does not
have an account, the VR counselor may assist the applicant in navigating the steps to create one.
While this documentation supports the presumption of eligibility and the existence of a
significant disability and, thus, an eligibility determination by a qualified VR counselor, it will
likely not be sufficient for accurately assigning a priority of service category. As defined in
## Section 7(21)(E)(i) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(29), an “individual with a
most significant disability” means an individual with a significant disability who meets the
DSU’s criteria for an individual with a most significant disability. These criteria must be
consistent with the requirements in Section 101(a)(5)(C) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.36(d)(1) and (2). Because an award letter from the SSA, alone, will not be sufficient for
assigning a priority category related to the definition of an individual with a most significant
disability, VR agencies may also find that additional medical or educational data are needed for
assigning the individual to a priority of service category and determining service needs for IPE
development.

Second, Section 102(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(2) create a
presumption that applicants with disabilities can benefit from the VR program, thereby helping

to expedite the eligibility process, for purposes of satisfying the requirement at 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.42(a)(1)(iii).

It is the Department’s longstanding interpretation that a determination that an applicant has a
physical or mental impairment, or meets any of the other eligibility criteria, must be made by
personnel who meet existing licensure, certification, or registration requirements applicable to
their profession (62 FR 6308, 6324 (Feb. 11, 1997)). In addition to licensed medical and mental
health professionals, the Department has long stated its belief that “qualified personnel” for
purposes of 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i) and (ii), “encompass individuals who are certified under
State law and individuals licensed or certified under State regulations” (60 FR 64476, 64487
(Dec. 15, 1995)). Although “qualified personnel” need not be medical or mental health
professionals in all instances, the Department “anticipates that in most instances [eligibility]
determinations will be supported by medical documentation” (Id.). DSUs can ensure they use
existing data and documentation, including information from educational agencies to the
maximum extent appropriate to make eligibility determinations, as required by Section 102(a)(4)
of the Rehabilitation Act, and consistent with the assessment for eligibility determination

process, as defined at Section 7(2)(A)(i) of the Rehabilitation Act, which means a review of
existing data.

The determination of a disability must be made by qualified personnel1 certified or licensed to
make such determinations in the State, which may include VR counselors holding such
certifications or licensures.2 A qualified VR counselor is critical to expediting the assessment for
determining eligibility and priority for services, as described in 34 C.F.R. § 361.42. State VR
agencies must establish standards that are consistent with any national or State-approved or
recognized certification, licensing, or registration requirements, or, in the absence of these
requirements, other comparable requirements (including State personnel requirements) that apply
to the profession or discipline in which those personnel are providing VR services, and must
ensure personnel have a 21st-century understanding of the evolving labor force and the needs of
individuals with disabilities (Section 101(a)(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.18(c)). Agencies must ensure they recruit, prepare, and retain personnel who are qualified
in accordance with required personnel standards.3


VR agencies employ a variety of personnel who interact with both individuals with disabilities
and employers, but a qualified VR counselor must meet the education and experience standards
of the profession, consistent with those set forth at Section 101(a)(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act
and 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c). Although Section 101(a)(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended
by WIOA, broadened the education and experience requirements for qualified rehabilitation
personnel, the requirement remains that the DSU must maintain personnel standards that are
“consistent with any national or State-approved or recognized certification, licensing, or
registration requirements, or, in the absence of these requirements, other comparable
requirements (including State personnel requirements).” Therefore, it is essential that the DSU
establish personnel standards in its Unified or Combined State Plan, consistent with Federal
requirements at Section 101(a)(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c),
including the specialized training and experience described in 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c)(2)(ii),
which enable the qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU to work effectively with
individuals with disabilities to assist them in achieving competitive integrated employment and
to work with employers who hire them.


Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii), only a qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU
(i.e., those VR counselors meeting the personnel standards established by the DSU pursuant to
## Section 101(a)(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c)) may make eligibility
determinations for individuals with disabilities applying for services under the VR program. This
responsibility is consistent with the non-delegable functions reserved solely for the VR program,
specifically those set forth at 34 C.F.R. § 361.13(c)(i) (i.e., all decisions affecting eligibility for
VR services, the nature and scope of available services, and the provision of VR services).
Therefore, VR agencies must ensure that only those VR counselors who are “qualified” in
accordance with the State's personnel standards for VR counselors, as set forth in the State’s
approved Unified or Combined State Plan, are assigned the task of determining eligibility, as
permitted by 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii).

1 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i).
## 2 Although neither the Rehabilitation Act nor its implementing regulations address State licensure or certifications
for purposes of determining whether personnel are qualified to determine whether an individual has a disability, the
Department has stated its position during past rulemaking processes. See relevant preamble discussions at 60 FR
64476, 64477-64478 (Dec. 15, 1995), 62 FR 6308, 6324-6325 (February 11, 1997), 65 FR 10620, 10625-10627
(Feb. 28, 2000), and 66 FR 4380, 4427-4428 (Jan. 17, 2001).
3 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(b).

When developing the State’s personnel standards to be included in the approved Unified or
Combined State Plan, the State must establish and maintain education and experience
requirements to ensure, among other things, that the personnel have a 21st-century understanding
of the needs of individuals with disabilities (34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c)(1)(ii)). The range of
education and experience that States must consider when establishing personnel standards, in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c), are set forth at 34 C.F.R. § 361.18 (c)(1)(A) and (B). For
those personnel employed as a qualified VR counselor by the DSU, these minimum education
and experience standards, set forth in the State’s established personnel standards approved in the
State’s Unified or Combined State Plan, lay the foundation for indicating a level of competency
and skill with respect to the needs of individuals with disabilities. This is particularly important
for those non-delegable functions that can only be performed by qualified VR counselors

employed by the DSU, such as determining individuals with disabilities eligible for the VR
program in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii). VR agencies should exercise prudence
when establishing personnel standards and ensure personnel responsible for making disability-
related decisions have the appropriate knowledge and experience. To that end, for example, some
State VR agencies have established and maintained personnel standards for VR counselors that
require advanced training in a field of study related to disability or rehabilitation or a
professional certification in rehabilitation counseling.

Eligibility Determinations – Balancing Expedited Decisions with Meaningful Engagement

During the eligibility determination process, which begins what will eventually become a
sustained and meaningful engagement between the participant and VR counselor, the “qualified
VR counselor employed by the DSU” could also constitute “qualified personnel,” for purposes of
the determinations that must be made in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i) and (ii)
(i.e., that the applicant has a physical or mental impairment and that the physical or mental
impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment) However, as noted
above, for a VR counselor to be qualified to do so, the State must have established personnel

standards in its approved Unified or Combined State Plan that indicate its VR counselors have
the competency and skill to make such determinations, which are comprehensive in nature,
thereby promoting sustained meaningful engagement between the individual with a disability
and the VR counselor. As noted above, such competency and skill are demonstrated in the
State’s standards through relevant education and experience consistent with Federal requirements
set forth at Section 101(7)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.18(c)). However,
even if a State’s established personnel standards in its approved Unified or Combined State Plan
specify VR counselors who are “qualified” to make the various determinations required by 34
C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1), including those at 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i) and (ii), additional
documentation may still be needed from other “qualified personnel,” either internal or external to
the DSU, to document the applicant’s impairment or substantial impediment to employment
before the qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU can determine the applicant is eligible
for VR services. When additional documentation is necessary to determine eligibility, it is the
responsibility of the qualified VR counselor to assess disability-related information (e.g.,
supporting documentation from medical and educational records), make the eligibility
determination, and document in the record of service how the requirements of eligibility are met,

thereby satisfying 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii) and § 361.47(a)(1).

Similarly, a qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU, even though experienced in the needs
of individuals with disabilities generally, may need additional information or documentation
from other qualified personnel, either internal or external to the DSU, to determine whether the
applicant requires VR services to prepare for, obtain, maintain, advance in, or regain
employment that is consistent with the applicant’s unique strength, resources, priorities,
concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, as required by 34 C.F.R. §
361.42(a)(1)(iii). The qualified VR counselor may obtain existing data or may need to obtain
additional information and data, through the assessment process, as defined at Section 7(2)(A)(ii)
of the Rehabilitation Act, to make any of the determinations at 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1). At each
stage of the assessment process, the qualified VR counselor should be engaging with the
applicant, explaining the need for the additional information and the benefit it will provide in
expediting the process and the eligibility determination. Although qualified VR counselors may

not be trained diagnosticians, medical and mental health records can assist qualified VR
counselors, who are trained in interpreting such reports, in comprehending any secondary
disabilities or medical conditions that should be considered in assessing the eligibility and VR
service needs of an applicant. For example, although a qualified VR counselor may readily
observe a disability, such as an amputation of a limb, and, thus, could make determinations
required by 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i) and (ii), other assessment information and reports by
other certified or licensed professionals could provide the qualified VR counselor with
invaluable information. For example, an individual with an amputated leg may also experience
medical conditions, such as diabetes or post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus, observation of a
visible disability by a qualified VR counselor may be sufficient to determine that an applicant is
an individual with a disability as required by 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(i); it alone may not be
sufficient to determine a secondary disability, nor may it be sufficient to determine if the
applicant's physical or mental impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to
employment as required by 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(ii).

In the event a qualified VR counselor determines that additional information to make an
eligibility determination is necessary, the VR counselor should inform the applicant. In arranging

for any additional assessment activities, the VR counselor should engage the applicant in making
informed choice of providers, such as with respect to any necessary medical, psychiatric,
psychological, and physical capacity evaluations. The documentation from qualified personnel
must reflect a determination that the individual has an impairment and the impairment results in
a substantial impediment to employment, to assist the qualified VR counselor employed by the
VR agency in making an eligibility determination. For example, an applicant reports having
bipolar disorder on the application for services, and at the intake interview, they do not bring any
medical documentation to support the diagnosis, but reports they were treated by a doctor in a
different State. Because the qualified VR counselor cannot observe any current impacts of the
disability solely based on interactions with the applicant during the intake interview, the VR
counselor should obtain permission to request medical records from the applicant’s prior treating
provider and, if needed, arrange for a psychological evaluation to substantiate the diagnosis for
eligibility determination purposes. In other words, the qualified VR counselor cannot determine
this applicant eligible without obtaining additional information because there is insufficient
information to make any of the eligibility determinations at 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1).

## Page 11







For applicants who have a congenital or permanent disability, existing historical medical and
educational information may be sufficient for the purpose of determining eligibility. For
example, an applicant who is blind who presents documentation of permanent blindness to the
qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU during the intake interview could be determined
eligible by that counselor on the basis of that historical information, pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §
361.42(a)(1). However, even though the qualified VR counselor can easily determine this
applicant eligible, it could be beneficial to obtain other current records relevant to the
information learned during the interview in order to have a better understanding of the eligible
individual’s scope of VR service needs. On the other hand, an applicant’s self-report of a
traumatic brain injury (TBI) with no supporting data or records created by a qualified
diagnostician is not sufficient to make an eligibility determination. An assessment, such as
neuropsychological evaluation, is necessary to support an eligibility determination for VR

services. In pursuing an assessment, the qualified VR counselor should engage the applicant in
meaningful ways, explaining the process and obtaining informed choice of the providers
whenever possible.

Trial work experiences offer another opportunity for engagement during the eligibility
determination process. In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(e), VR counselors may decide that
trial work experiences will help determine whether an individual with a significant disability can
benefit from VR services in terms of an employment outcome. Engaging an applicant during the
development of a written plan for the trial work experience is essential to ensure a sufficient
variety of experiences over a sufficient period of time, along with appropriate supports, to
accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the individual during the trial work experiences.
Appropriate supports could include assistive technology devices and services, and personal
assistance services. Taking into consideration the individual’s unique strengths, resources,
priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice also builds rapport to
support communication of the results of the trial work experience. The trial work experience
should be extensive enough that it produces sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual
can benefit from the provision of VR services in terms of an employment outcome, or yield clear

and convincing evidence that an individual is incapable of benefitting from the provision of VR
services in terms of an employment outcome to support an ineligibility determination.4 Ensuring
consistent communication and engagement with an individual throughout the trial work process
facilitates individual choice in the settings and supports needed to produce the most accurate
results and inform the eligibility determination.

The supporting documentation obtained for the purposes of eligibility determination will likely
also serve as substantiating documentation for determining a priority for services (if the State is
operating under an order of selection as outlined in Section 101(a)(5) of the Rehabilitation Act
and 34 C.F.R. § 361.36). Determining eligibility and assigning a priority for services are
companion activities, meaning they are separate determinations, but the information and records
used in determining eligibility is often critical to informing the assessment for priority for
services (i.e., with the review of data to determine functional capacities that are seriously limited
by a severe physical or mental impairment) (34 C.F.R. §§ 361.30 and 361.29). As previously
discussed, if an individual has additional medical or psychological information or undergoes an
assessment that reveals other disabilities, such information and documentation will assist in


## 4 Section 102(a)(2)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act.

assigning the individual to the appropriate priority category for a VR agency that has established
and implemented an order of selection (Section 102(a)(2)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act).

Flexibilities Under the Rehabilitation Act for Expediting and Ensuring Engagement During
## Eligibility Determination

Rapid engagement of applicants can also occur if a VR agency elects to develop and implement
policies for interim eligibility determinations. While an interim determination is not a full and
final determination, as outlined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(b)(3), the VR agency can initiate the
assessment of VR needs and services based on an interim determination of eligibility prior to the
60-day period but must make a final determination of eligibility within 60 days of the individual
submitting an application for services in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(b)(2). This method

of eligibility determination may assist some agencies in quickly engaging individuals while
awaiting additional information to support the final determination. Applying the flexibility of
interim eligibility determination can be useful when an applicant has an observable disability or
reports having a disability that is apparent to a VR counselor but may require additional
supporting documentation. For example, if an applicant who presents wearing a medically
prescribed back brace, commonly known as a Boston brace, self-reports chronic back pain and
limited mobility as a result of scoliosis, and states medical documentation exists that clearly
indicates a history of scoliosis, the qualified VR counselor can assess applicant self-report as
well as document counselor observations of the Boston brace to make an interim eligibility
determination while awaiting additional supporting documentation from the applicant’s treating
physician. In this example, the documentation needed is a report of the applicant’s limitations in
order for the qualified VR counselor to make a determination that the disability poses a
substantial impediment to employment, as required by 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(ii).

## Supporting and Facilitating Eligibility Documentation

No method of determining eligibility waives the requirement to obtain documentation supporting

an eligibility determination in the record of services as outlined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.47, or the
determination by a qualified VR counselor employed by the DSU (i.e., the VR agency) that the
applicant requires VR services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment
that is consistent with the individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities,
capabilities, interest, and informed choice (34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(iii)). Supporting
documentation, including information from educational agencies serving students with
disabilities, and written documentation provided by qualified personnel duly licensed and
certified by States to determine whether an individual is an “individual with a disability,” may
assist the VR counselor in establishing eligibility and can often easily be obtained through online
patient and student portals. To expedite eligibility determination and foster engagement, VR
agencies are encouraged to train staff on assisting applicants in accessing electronic records,
using existing documentation to the maximum extent possible, understanding the responsibilities
of qualified VR counselors in making eligibility determinations, exercising available flexibilities
under the Rehabilitation Act for making eligibility determinations, and prioritizing timely and
engaged communications and relationships with applicants and eligible individuals.

## Sustained Engagement When Implementing an Order of Selection

VR agencies implementing an order of selection have multiple opportunities to facilitate and
improve the engagement of eligible individuals on a waiting list. Continued engagement while
awaiting services is paramount in retaining the interest of individuals with disabilities, assisting
them in accessing no cost or comparable benefits and services, and increasing employment
readiness. The more individuals can engage in activities, including pre-employment transition
services for students prior to being determined eligible or before being released from a waiting
list, the better informed such individuals can be about needed services and their employment
goals. Ultimately, consistent and meaningful communication and engagement with individuals
while they are awaiting services may reduce the number of individuals exiting the VR program,
reduce case closures prior to developing the IPE and beginning VR services, and increase the

number of participants successfully achieving their employment goals. While operating under an
order of selection (Section 101(a)(5) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.36), an
agency may adopt policies and practices that facilitate meaningful engagement, such as setting
timely and routine check-ins with eligible individuals who are placed in a priority category that
is closed or making referrals to other programs that can provide supports or training to help
prepare individuals for their employment journey with the VR program. For example, AJCs may
have potential information or training opportunities that could complement or expedite the
completion of VR services once an eligible individual is removed from a waiting list and is able
to be served. Helping individuals on the waiting list contact transportation programs, social
service agencies, or relevant community programs, such as independent living centers, can help
create a foundation of personalized concern and trust that the VR agency is working proactively
in the best interests of eligible individuals as they await VR services.

## Maximizing Meaningful Engagement During Planning and Services

Meaningful and sustained engagement requires a holistic approach and an ongoing relationship
built upon trust and respect. This applies to both VR program participants and VR staff. Planning

for VR services begins with an assessment and comprehensive understanding by both the VR
counselor and eligible individual regarding the eligible individual’s needs, disability-related
challenges, desired goals, educational and work history, cultural influences, personal and
professional strengths, motivation, and environmental challenges. This cannot be accomplished
without affording the opportunity for the VR counselor and the individual to establish an
ongoing relationship, which to be successful will need to be built on regular good
communication and mutual respect. Such a relationship can be built both virtually and in person.
VR agency management can support VR counselors and other frontline staff by removing,
revising, or restructuring burdensome policies, practices, or alignment of staff duties that may
inhibit timely engagement and meaningful interactions with VR program participants while
continuing to maintain necessary internal controls. One such example might be eliminating the
initial and annual assessment of financial need to determine participant costs in allowable
services. Another example might be assigning processing and follow-up tasks to support staff.
Evaluating and implementing even small changes can result in big dividends in terms of
developing meaningful engagement among VR staff and between VR counselors and the
individuals they serve.

## Benefits Planning and Financial Literacy

VR counselors and benefits planners should provide participants with information about how the
VR program can change the financial trajectory of their lives, and their future possibilities if they
can move away from solely relying on SSDI or SSI benefits by supplementing their income and
leveraging work incentives, or ideally, engage in employment paying good wages and benefits
that eliminates dependence on or the need for public benefits. Section 102(b)(2) of the
Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.45(c)(3) require that individuals entitled to benefits under
Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act on the basis of a disability or blindness be
provided general information on additional support and assistance for individuals with
disabilities desiring to enter the workforce, including assistance with benefits planning. Agencies
are encouraged to augment benefits planning services available through SSA or community-

based Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) programs, by developing VR counselor
knowledge regarding Social Security disability benefits and associated work incentives and/or
building a team of in-house Community Work Incentive Coordinators (CWIC) who can engage
participants in an analysis of available work incentives and the effect of work upon benefits and
potential long-range financial security. Providing professional development opportunities for VR
counselors to expand their understanding of disability benefits and work incentives increases the
likelihood and quality of conversations that can help participants maximize their possible
employment outcomes.

Students with disabilities who are receiving transition planning under an IPE or participating in
pre-employment transition services may benefit from financial literacy training and workplace
readiness or work-based learning activities in which they learn about money, personal finances,
and budgeting. Such activities help them understand the complexities of money, whether from
public benefit programs or earned from an employer, or both. Benefits planning services as part
of financial literacy training may shift a student’s view from one of concern to one of hope and
the possibility of a brighter financial future. An individual receiving SSA disability-related
benefits prior to participating in a paid work-based learning experience should receive benefits

planning beforehand, to understand SSA’s wage reporting requirements and to help alleviate fear
and confusion around the process, creating a proactive learning experience that can add to future
success.

Benefits planning should be provided at multiple points within the continuum of VR services to
support informed choice. It may be appropriate, for example, to provide benefits planning
services during pre-employment transition services, IPE development, upon an employment
offer, or the offer of a raise or an advancement opportunity. Benefits planning services can also
help answer questions and alleviate concerns individuals, their families, and others may have
about the effect of work on the receipt or loss of benefits and assist with making an appropriate
informed choice of an employment goal, including the wage and hours of work. An individual
interested in going to work might have a life-long fear of losing their disability-related benefits
and may be uncertain about a number of factors, including whether they will be able to work
given their disability, whether they will need workplace accommodations, transportation
challenges related to getting to work, whether they can keep their healthcare benefits, and
whether they will have less money. Providing individuals with disabilities with benefits planning

services is a way to provide support and ensure informed decision-making related to
employment.

## Meaningful Engagement in Vocational Assessment and Career Exploration

Vocational assessment and career exploration are essential to the development of an IPE. When
conducted in a manner that provides informed choice (34 C.F.R. § 361.52 and Section 102(d) of
the Rehabilitation Act), in conjunction with counseling and guidance, such assessment and
evaluation is valuable and informative and can result in the greatest likelihood of successful
achievement of an employment goal. Assessing VR need, as outlined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.45(b)(1)
and (f), is an individualized approach. It can be fairly simple when an individual is seeking
advancement in employment, enters the VR program with an employment goal and a self-written

IPE that identifies the nature and scope of VR services that can be supported by their VR
counselor, or the information used to determine eligibility and priority for services provides
enough data to substantiate and expedite disability-related services needed and identified on the
IPE without the need for comprehensive assessment. Alternately, through meaningful and
sustained engagement, a VR counselor may identify the need for additional information or
assessments to support a fully developed IPE or an amendment to the original IPE.

Comprehensive assessment engages individuals with disabilities when additional data are
necessary to determine an employment outcome and the required IPE services (34 C.F.R. §
361.45 (f)(2)). When conducted with the IPE in mind, the information derived from
comprehensive assessment informs plan development and helps to determine the unique
strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice,
including the needs for supported employment (34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(5)(ii)). There may be other
areas in a person’s life that may require further exploration, including cultural values, language-
related needs, or other challenges such as housing struggles, childcare needs, access to
transportation, and essential needs related to independent living. While the comprehensive
assessment uses, to the maximum extent possible, existing information or information provided

by the individual or their network of support necessary to identify their rehabilitation needs to
develop the IPE, there may be instances when additional information is needed.

An individual may not be aware of the variety of assessment tools available to help inform
decision-making, and through the careful guidance of a VR counselor, information can be shared
that will encourage active participation in the vocational assessment and career exploration
process. VR services and systems can seem complicated. Therefore, strong communication and
facilitation are necessary to optimize results. A qualified VR counselor should introduce and
explain the types of assessments and career exploration tools available to assist an individual in
making thoughtful decisions regarding their rehabilitation services as well as the need for the
assessment when requested or required to participate in such activities. It may be necessary to
evaluate patterns of behavior, attitudes, habits, and tolerance related to work, in typical
employment settings through community-based work assessments, to assess and further develop
the capacities of an individual to perform adequately in a work environment (34 C.F.R.
§ 361.5(c)(5)(ii)(C), (D) and (E)). These aforementioned activities are critical in helping to
identify the services needed to achieve the employment outcome on an IPE, which may include

the provision of assistive technology devices and services, personal assistance services, and

15

## Page 16







transition services for a student or youth with a disability (34 C.F.R. § 361.46(a)(2)) as well as
the specific supported employment services for and individual with a most significant disability
for whom an employment outcome in a supported employment setting has been deemed to be
appropriate, including the expected extended services needed (34 C.F.R. § 361.46(b)).

## Individual Engagement in IPE Development

Developing an IPE can be simple or complex, while personalized and tailored to the individual
who has an agreed upon a specific employment outcome in competitive integrated employment.
For a student with a disability, the IPE should take into account the student’s IEP or 504 services
and reflect the financial responsibilities of the State education agency (SEA) as outlined in the
interagency agreement, as applicable (34 C.F.R. §§ 361.45(d)(9) and 361.22). IPEs must be

designed to achieve a specific employment outcome, as defined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(15), that
is selected by the individual consistent with the individual's unique strengths, resources,
priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice (34 C.F.R.
§ 361.45(b)(2)). For a student or youth with a disability, an IPE may include a description of the
individual’s projected post-school employment outcome, as provided in 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.46(a)(1), that will be refined to a specific employment outcome as the student or youth
participates in VR services. In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.46(a)(2), an IPE must also
include the VR services needed to achieve the employment outcome, including any necessary
specific transition services and supports.

Many factors influence a chosen employment outcome. Therefore, it is important to explore an
individual’s personal and professional strengths, past successes and challenges, and desired
income, as well as the occupation. Evaluating existing and easy-to-access information regarding
employment potential, both in today’s labor market and the future, will help support
conversations with an individual with a disability regarding their goals, time commitment,
disability-related challenges, and plan for success. Individuals with disabilities should be
provided informed choice and encouraged to reach their highest employment potential. VR

professionals can facilitate IPE development to include services that support an employment
outcome that is not simply an entry point in a field or the easiest position to obtain, but rather
mid- to high-level positions that are in high demand, offer competitive pay, and desirable
benefits packages. Qualified VR professionals bring significant, if not unique, value to these
conversations because they are accustomed to addressing disability.

IPE development is critical to the perception and realization of the advantages the VR program
provides to an individual with a disability, including a student or youth with a disability. While
an IPE can and most often is developed with assistance from a qualified VR counselor employed
by the State VR agency, there are flexibilities and multiple options that empower individuals to
actively participate in their individualized plan development, as described in 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.45(c)(1) and allow an individual to engage with and seek assistance from others in the
development of an IPE. For an individual with a most significant disability, who, because of the
nature and severity of their disabilities has not historically obtained competitive integrated
employment or such employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of their
disability, needs intensive supported employment services and extended services as described in



16





---
## Page 17







## 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(53) and (54), and for whom supported employment has been deemed
appropriate, the IPE must:

- •  Specify the supported employment services to be provided by the VR agency;
- •  Provide for the transition of an individual with a most significant disability, including a
youth with a most significant disability, to extended services no later than 24 months or
longer, if needed, after the individual enters supported employment; and
- •  Identify the source of extended services as defined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(19).


Clearly communicating the coordination efforts that the VR agency will undertake on behalf of
the individual requiring supported employment services may reassure participants that the
complex system of providers and services can be navigated and may alleviate any hesitation to
fully participate in VR services.

Per 34 C.F.R. § 361.45(d)(3), the eligible individual must agree to the IPE, and the IPE must be
approved and signed by a qualified VR counselor employed by the State VR agency. This
collaborative process commits both parties to success. It is also an opportunity to review
responsibilities, reiterate mutual expectations associated with each step in the IPE, acknowledge
the potential for success, and begin facilitating access to the planned services that are required to
reach the participant’s maximum potential. The seamless and timely delivery of VR services
fosters meaningful and sustained engagement and maximizes the likelihood of meeting
expectations and commitments.

## Engagement During Fulfillment of IPE Services

Engagement with the participant is a critical element to the successful fulfillment of IPE

services. The qualified VR counselor’s interaction with the participant while coordinating VR
and supported employment services is important during this phase. Specifically, while there may
be steps or milestones within an IPE that are reached or accomplished by the participant, the
services to complete the steps or achieve the milestones are most often coordinated, provided, or
paid for by the State VR agency. The coordination of VR and supported employment services
may seem daunting to someone navigating the complex system of supports required to achieve
competitive integrated employment. The knowledge and experience of qualified VR
professionals are often essential to successfully facilitate the seamless delivery of VR and
supported employment services. While a participant and the qualified VR counselor determine
the required VR services, both the counselor and other VR staff, (e.g., rehabilitation technicians,
business engagement specialists) coordinate and facilitate access to the services outlined in the
IPE. An individual with a disability may be unsure of when or how to access coordinated
services; however, clear and consistent communication from the State VR agency staff and its
vendors will help to maintain a high level of engagement. While interactions may be frequent
during the initial weeks or months after an individual is determined eligible for services, a VR
agency is encouraged to establish policies or procedures outlining the minimum frequency of

contact with individuals receiving VR services.

If an individual is participating in a training or education program, communication should be
maintained to reinforce the available support of the VR program in the event any challenges arise

17





---
## Page 18







and to celebrate the success of related achievements. Waiting until the end of an academic term
may be too late to navigate any related issues or challenges that may prohibit success and could
negatively impact a person’s progress towards achieving the goal on their IPE. Establishing
expectations for regular and frequent communication by both VR agency staff and individuals
participating in IPE services may result in opportunities to discuss progress, offer or request
necessary supports, and foster effective engagement. When solid foundational relationships are
established, they provide a safe space in which challenges can be discussed and addressed, as
appropriate, to support the best possible result, reduce the likelihood of attrition, and increase the
success of achieving milestones or completing steps within an IPE.

When ongoing support services, as defined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(37), are required to achieve
employment in a competitive integrated environment, communication and collaboration among

the individual with a disability, the VR counselor, and service providers are key to sustain
engagement and maintain the required levels of participation in services to reach the greatest
level of employment success. The regular monitoring and follow-up services that are included in
ongoing support services are paramount to ensure frequent contact and engagement of the
employer, the individual, and their network of support to reinforce and stabilize the job
placement in supported employment.

## Post-Employment Services

Assessing and collaborating on an individual’s post-employment needs is fundamental to
keeping individuals with disabilities engaged from start to finish. The key to post-employment
services, as defined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(41), is ensuring the amended IPE includes those
short-term services needed prior to closing the record of services of an individual who has
achieved an employment outcome and providing or arranging for those services during the
period of job stabilization, but prior to case closure and exit. The required 90-day timeframe for
keeping a VR case service record open after the participant’s achievement of an employment
outcome represents a minimum timeframe (34 C.F.R. § 361.56(b)). If additional services are

needed for an individual to maintain employment, a VR agency should employ flexibility in
policy and practice to ensure the case remains open to allow sufficient delivery of required post-
employment services. It is important for the VR counselor and the participant to discuss the
potential need for post-employment services that would require an amendment to the IPE. When
services are quickly identified and provided in a timely manner, they assist an individual with a
disability in achieving the highest level of stabilization in employment and support their long-
term employment success. VR agencies are reminded there is no provision for an individual to
continue to receive VR services, including post-employment services, after their case has been
closed and they have exited the VR program without reapplying for services. Keeping a case
open to ensure employment is maintained through the delivery of post-employment services
reassures the individual with a disability that their continued success is a priority and their goal
to achieve high-quality employment will be fully accomplished.

## Recognizing Success in the VR Program

The commitment and dedication to the VR process, participation in services, and ultimately

achieving the employment outcome identified on an IPE often culminates in receipt of the first

18





---
## Page 19







paycheck and the satisfaction in successfully meeting or exceeding an employer’s expectations.
Recognition of such achievement is important to not only the individual with a disability who
has worked hard to reach their goal but also to the VR professionals who helped along the way.
VR agencies are encouraged to identify opportunities and find connections within their States to
bolster support for and acknowledgment of VR participants and agency personnel. If appropriate
consent forms or information releases are signed, a VR agency should consider engaging public
officials, legislators, or department heads in personalizing congratulatory letters for successful
program participants, as well as spotlighting the success of both participants and agency
personnel on VR agency websites or through public meetings with stakeholder groups.
Highlighting the types of VR services an individual with a disability received while participating
in services helps to emphasize the value and significance of VR services for stakeholders,
professionals, and public officials while at the same time providing examples of success for other

VR participants or individuals with disabilities, including students with disabilities, who are
considering applying for services. The impact of a VR agency may be underestimated; the social
and fiscal return on investment should not go unrecognized, and no longer can agencies remain a
quiet partner in employment successes or the “best kept secret” in town.

Recognition of success often begins with agency leadership who can establish recognition
programs for participants and agency personnel. Advertising the accomplishments of program
participants who achieve measurable skill gains through education and training, as well as high-
quality employment and credential attainment, helps to elevate the VR program within the
workforce system and the local community while also providing inspiration to others.
Acknowledging dedicated counseling professionals who tirelessly serve and work to facilitate
the employment achievement of individuals with disabilities through formal an informal
recognition as well as competitive pay within their respective State demonstrates the
commitment of the VR program to the employment success of individuals with disabilities and
the retention of qualified VR professionals. Additionally, recognizing areas of professional
expertise may be helpful in better serving individuals with specific types of disabilities. Agency
leadership could consider implementing alternate caseload management strategies built upon the

experience, strengths, and knowledge of VR professionals to increase access to services that
require familiarity and connections with specific resources. When individuals with specific
disabilities are connected quickly to required and meaningful supports, they may be more likely
to remain engaged in services and realize the value of VR services in a more profound way that
builds their confidence and increases the likelihood of their long-term success.

VR agencies may consider developing mentoring programs that match successful past program
participants with individuals who are just beginning their journey to employment. Mentorship
can be a positive experience for both the mentor and mentee and allows for the sharing of unique
experiences while offering support and VR program-related information from a participant's
perspective. Mentors can share their stories of success and their path to employment, including
improvements to their financial future; they may also be a source of inspiration or
encouragement as well as provide thoughts or ideas to help navigate the VR process.
Establishing a strong mentoring program may lead to increased engagement and reduced
attrition, ultimately resulting an increase in successful outcomes in high-quality competitive
integrated employment.

# CONCLUSION

The continued success of the VR program will rely heavily on the perception of the quality and
value of VR services coupled with positive and results-driven experiences of individuals with
disabilities, including students with disabilities. The interactions between participants, VR
agency personnel, and VR service providers, along with the timeliness, quality, and types of
services received, directly impact a VR agency’s performance and the employment success of
VR program participants. Providing superior services, facilitated by highly qualified VR
professionals, attracts individuals with disabilities to the VR program who are eager to engage in
services that will help them to achieve their employment goals and exceed their expectations.
Creating intentional opportunities for engagement throughout the continuum of VR services,
including pre-employment transition services, provides a foundation for consistent and

predictable interactions between an individual with a disability and the VR agency. Consistency
supports relationship-building and increases trust in the program and services. Agencies that
create a culture around valuing and recognizing highly-skilled personnel with diverse expertise
and knowledge can recruit and retain a team of VR professionals who know their expertise is
valued. Publicizing participant and personnel success helps to engage stakeholders,
professionals, and public officials, reinforces the value in the State VR Services Program, and
shapes the perception of VR in the statewide workforce development system. VR participants
count on the services that VR agencies have to offer, and offering the highest level of
individualized services via highly skilled and valued personnel is the most effective way of
engaging individuals with disabilities and ensuring their greatest possible success.
