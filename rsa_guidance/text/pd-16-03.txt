CLIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

SUBJECT: Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Requirements for
Unified and Combined State Plans

PURPOSE: This policy directive (PD) conveys the following to States:

• • The vision and content requirements for Unified and Combined State
Plans under WIOA;

• • The deadline and submission process for Unified and Combined State
Plans under WIOA (Instructions for Plan Submission section);
• • The requirements to have approved Unified or Combined State Plans in
place for Program Year (PY) 2016 and beyond for the six core
programs of WIOA; and
• • The options for States to incorporate all or portions of partner programs
into their State plan submissions if they choose to submit a Combined
State Plan.

This guidance—developed jointly by the Departments of Labor (DOL),
Education (ED), Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA),
and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (Departments)—provides an
overview of the Administration’s priorities in relation to the WIOA

planning requirements, explains the planning requirements where
necessary, and instructs States regarding submission procedures. Each of
these Departments will issue similar guidance separately. This guidance
also provides the deadlines for the Unified or Combined State Plan,
depending on which option the State chooses to submit, as well as
modification requirements. The Departments recognize that States have
been engaged in the planning process for the initial Unified or Combined
State Plan for some time and commend States for their efforts while
awaiting finalization of the requirements and guidance from the
Departments.

For the initial four-year Unified and Combined State Plans, States must
submit their Unified or Combined State Plans to the Departments by

---
Page 2

March 3, 2016; however, Plans submitted by April 1, 2016 will be
considered timely. States should submit the Plans via the online portal
described in the Instructions for Plan Submission section.

WIOA became law on July 22, 2014 and supersedes titles I and II of the
Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), and amends the Wagner-
Peyser Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The Departments of Labor and Education published a set of proposed
regulations for implementing WIOA through the posting of five Notices of
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRMs) documents. These NPRMs were open for
public comment until June 15, 2015, and the Federal agencies are
reviewing, analyzing, and considering all comments received. The final

WIOA rules will be issued in 2016.

POLICY: Background

WIOA requires the Governor of each State to submit a Unified or
Combined State Plan to the Secretary of Labor that includes a four-year
strategy for the State’s workforce development system. States must have
Federally-approved State Plans in place to receive funding for the six core
programs. At a minimum, States must submit a Unified State Plan, which
encompasses the six core programs under WIOA. States have the option to
submit a Combined State Plan, which includes the six core programs of the
Unified State Plan, plus one or more other partner programs, described at
the Unified and Combined State Plan Options section of this PD. For
purposes of the Unified or Combined State Plans, the term “State” refers to
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and, as
appropriate for certain programs, the Republic of Palau.

Unified and Combined State Plan Options

A State has two options for submitting a WIOA State Plan: a Unified State
Plan or a Combined State Plan. Section 102(a) of WIOA requires each
State, at a minimum, to submit a Unified State Plan that fosters strategic
alignment of the core programs, which are:

• • the Adult program (Title I),
• • the Dislocated Worker program (Title I),
• • the Youth program (Title I),
• • the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (Adult Education or
AEFLA) program (Title II),
• • the Wagner-Peyser Act program (Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended
by title III), and

2

---
Page 3

• • the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program (Title I of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV).

In addition, WIOA permits a State to submit a Combined State Plan
including the aforementioned core programs plus one or more of the
Combined State Plan partner programs listed in section 103(a)(2). States
choosing to submit a Combined State Plan must incorporate (1) all of the
common planning elements required in the Unified State Plan; (2)
additional elements describing how the State will coordinate the optional
programs with the core programs; and (3) additional elements required by
the Combined State Plan partner program(s) that are included (WIOA sec.
103(b)(3)).

More specifically, when a State includes a Combined State Plan partner
program in its Combined State Plan, the State need not submit a separate
plan or application for that particular program, with certain exceptions
identified in the Special Considerations for Combined State Plan Partner
Programs section of this PD. If included in the plan as a partner,
Combined State Plan programs are subject to the “common planning
elements” (Sections II-IV of the State Plan Requirements in the Unified
and Combined State Plan Information Collection Request (ICR) discussed
in the Planning Requirements section of this PD) and program-specific
requirements for that program when such planning requirements exist
separately for the program outside of WIOA. The Combined State Plan
partner programs are—

• • Career and technical education programs authorized under the Carl

• D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C.
2301 et seq.);
• • Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (42 U.S.C. 601
et seq.);
• • Employment and training programs under the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (programs authorized under section
6(d)(4) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C.
2015(d)(4));
• • Work programs authorized under section 6(o) of the Food and
Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2015(o));
• • Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers programs (Activities
authorized under chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 (19

U.S.C. 2271 et seq.));
• • Jobs for Veterans State Grants program (programs authorized under
38 U.S.C. 4100 et. seq.);
• • Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs (UI Federal-State
Programs administered under State unemployment compensation
laws in accordance with applicable Federal law);
• • Senior Community Service Employment Program (programs

3

Page 4

authorized under title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42
U.S.C. 3056 et seq.));
• • Employment and training activities carried out by HUD;
• • Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) (employment and
training activities carried out under the Community Services Block
Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.);1 and
• • Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program (programs authorized under
section 212 of the Second Chance Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17532).

Planning Requirements

States must use the ICR Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
• (WIOA) Unified and Combined State Plan Requirements published under
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1205-0522 to

develop and submit the WIOA Unified or Combined State Plan in
accordance with instructions described at the Instructions for Plan
Submission section. A copy of the ICR, which complies with statutory
requirements set forth in, as appropriate, sections 102 and 103 of WIOA, is
available at www.doleta.gov/wioa. A copy of these requirements is also
available through the web-based platform, discussed in the Instructions for
Plan Submission section, developed specifically for electronic submission.2

Purpose and Summary of the State Plan

Under WIOA, the Unified and Combined State Plans communicate the
State’s vision for the State workforce system and serve as a vehicle for
aligning and integrating this system across Federal programs. Previously
governed by WIA, WIOA improves planning requirements to foster better
alignment of Federal investments in job training and education, to integrate
service delivery across programs, to improve efficiency in service delivery,
and to ensure that the workforce system is job-driven and matches
employers with skilled individuals.

Specifically, this reform promotes a shared understanding of the workforce
needs within each State; fosters development of more comprehensive and

integrated approaches, such as career pathways and sector strategies, for
addressing the needs of businesses and workers; and enables the system to
provide a wider range of coordinated and streamlined services to their
shared customers. WIOA requires States to plan across core programs and
include this planning process in the Unified or Combined State Plans.
Economic, education, and workforce partners at the State, regional, and

1 States that elect to include employment and training activities carried out under the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Act (42
U.S.C. 9901 et seq.) under a Combined State Plan would submit all other required elements of a complete CSBG State Plan directly to the Federal
agency that administers the program. Similarly, States that elect to include employment and training activities carried out by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that are included would submit all other required elements of a complete State Plan for those programs directly
to the Federal agency that administers the program.
2 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Unified and Combined
State Plan Requirements under OMB Control Number 1205-0522 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.

local level should be engaged in this planning process with the goal of
improving the workforce development system.

State Plans should reflect strategies that advance these key WIOA
principles:

• • Increase access to and opportunities for the employment, education,
training, and support services that individuals, particularly those
with barriers to employment, need to succeed in the labor market;
• • Align workforce investment, education, and economic development
systems in support of a comprehensive, accessible, accountable, and

high-quality workforce development system;
• • Improve the quality and labor market relevance of workforce
investment, education, and economic development efforts;
• • Promote improvement in the structure and delivery of services;
• • Increase the prosperity of workers and employers, the economic
growth of communities, regions, and States, and the global
competitiveness of the United States;
• • Provide innovative workforce investment activities, through
integrated workforce development systems, that increase
employment, retention, and earnings of participants and that
increase postsecondary credential attainment and, as a result,
improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency,

increase economic self-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of
employers, and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the
nation; and
• • Measure effectiveness, improve transparency, and support informed
consumer choice through performance reporting, evaluation, and
data systems that support these activities.

Plan Structure

The Departments envision that this plan will describe how the State will
develop and implement a unified, integrated workforce system, rather than
a plan that separately discusses the State’s approach to operating each
program individually. The major content areas of the Unified or Combined
State Plan include strategic and operational planning elements. WIOA
separates the strategic and operational elements to facilitate cross-program
strategic planning. The Strategic Planning and Operational Planning
Elements are the “common elements” of the plan. They should incorporate
all of the core programs, any Combined State Plan partner programs that
are included and required one-stop partners. This new approach enables
States to involve different levels of the workforce system in developing the

appropriate sections of the plan. For example, the State Workforce
Development Board may focus on developing the State vision or setting
strategic direction in the Strategic Plan section, while the State agency may

5

---
Page 6

focus on the Operational Plan.

The Strategic Planning Elements of the Unified or Combined State Plan
must include an analysis of the State’s current economic environment and
identification of the State’s overall vision for its workforce development
system, including analyses of the State’s workforce characteristics and
workforce development activities. These analyses drive the required vision
and goals for the State’s workforce development system and alignment
strategies for workforce development programs to support economic
growth. For Combined State Plans, the Strategic Planning Elements apply
to Combined State Plan partner programs included in the plan as well as to
all of the core programs.

The Operational Planning Elements section identifies the State’s planned
actions to implement and support the State’s strategic vision and goals as
identified in the Strategic Planning Elements section. This section ensures
that the State has the necessary infrastructure, policies, and activities to
meet its strategic goals, implement its alignment strategy, and support
ongoing program development and coordination. The State Operational
Plan must elaborate on the Strategic Plan section relating to the State’s
plans and resources for an aligned and integrated workforce system by
discussing how the programs included in the State plan will serve various
individual participants. For instance, the State Operational Plan should
discuss how services for employers and various job seekers will be
delivered. Similarly, the State Plan must also describe the State’s plans to
align data systems and support evaluations. The structure of the
Operational Planning Elements in the law and ICR is:

• • State Strategy Implementation;

• • State Operating Systems and Policies;
• • Common Assurances;
• • Program-Specific Requirements for the Core Programs; and
• • Program-Specific Requirements for the Combined State Plan
partner programs.

Creating High Quality Strategic and Operational Planning Elements

The Departments encourage States to include the following factors in the
development and ongoing process of planning, over time, for the common
elements of the State Plan.

• a. Strategic and Operational Planning Elements should incorporate
WIOA’s key principles (noted above), as well as the Departments’
current policy priorities. In particular, the strategic and operational

planning elements should align with the Department of Labor’s
Vision for the Workforce System, as described in TEGL 19-14, and

Vision for the Workforce System, as described in TEGL 19-14, and

Page 7

the Departments’ shared Vision for the One-Stop Career Center
System, as described in Program Memorandum OCTAE 15-3.
States should also review Program Memorandum OCTAE/DAEL
15-4, Vision for the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act in the
Workforce System and Initial Implementation of the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act and other program memoranda and
resources available at
http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/wioa-
reauthorization.html to include program priorities as a part of state
planning where appropriate.

• b. Workforce programs operate within the context of a regional labor
market. States must use reliable labor market information and
workforce information as the basis for the development of policies,
strategic investments, program design, and service delivery, in order

to ensure that customers have high quality information available to
inform their decisions. The State Plan must include a description of
the labor market and economic conditions in the State to identify
critical industries, including population and workforce trends, and
describe the economic challenges facing the State that need to be
addressed to meet the needs of businesses, workers, and job seekers.
Strategies and program decisions at the State and local levels should
be based on, connected to, and aligned with the labor market trends
and economic analysis. The professional analysis of available data
should result in labor market relevant goals, strategies, and planned
outcomes that make an impact on regional labor markets, and that
advance the economic prosperity of customers served.

• c. Strategic and Operational Planning Elements should also reflect a
robust analysis of the State’s current workforce development,
education, and training activities, including their opportunities,
strengths, and weaknesses; their capacity to serve the needs of
businesses and individuals; their current level of cross-program
alignment; and their use of evidence-based practices.

• d. Operational Planning Elements should clearly articulate the specific
actions, milestones, and activities that the State will undertake to
increase program alignment and integration of services, and
describe ongoing assessment of those activities, as allowable by
law. While not all-inclusive, some important areas of program
alignment and integration include:

• i. Partnering across the Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, TANF,
Adult Education, VR, and other programs to implement
comprehensive career pathway approaches that align and bridge
training, education, employment, and supportive services at the
local and State levels. This partnership should engage

the Departments’ shared Vision for the One-Stop Career Center
System, as described in Program Memorandum OCTAE 15-3.
States should also review Program Memorandum OCTAE/DAEL
15-4, Vision for the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act in the
Workforce System and Initial Implementation of the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act and other program memoranda and
resources available at
http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/wioa-
reauthorization.html to include program priorities as a part of state
planning where appropriate.

employers and enable individuals to move beyond adult basic
education and succeed in postsecondary education, earn
industry-recognized credentials, and advance along a career
path.

ii. Partnering across the core programs, economic development,
education, and other programs to develop sector strategies and
other aligned services geared to serving businesses. Examples
include:

outreach and marketing to the business sector;
o
development of business engagement goals in collaboration
o
with members of the State Board;
training for Business Service Representatives (BSRs), Rapid
o
Response Coordinators and other staff that work directly
with businesses;
development of sector partnerships among State, local
o
businesses, professional service organizations and trade
associations including linkages with sponsors of registered
apprenticeship programs;
services and resources provided to business, including on-
o
the-job-training (OJT), customized training, incumbent
worker training, recruitment, toolkits, data visualization,
among others; and
development of standardized metrics of success for business
o
engagement activities such as repeat business, return on
investment, and new hires.
iii. Improving the connection between the WIOA core programs
and UI systems to enhance access to reemployment services for
all unemployed job seekers, including UI claimants and
transitioning veterans, and enhancing service delivery through
integrated service strategies and the creative use of technology.
iv. Using Registered Apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and
other work-based training strategies to meet the training needs
for all job seekers served by One-Stop Career Centers as well as
satisfying employer needs for access to skilled workers and
talent pipelines.
• v. Connecting the multiple systems that serve disconnected youth,
such as partnering with human service agencies to support
summer employment and work experiences throughout the year;
coordinating with Adult Education to ensure integrated
education and training opportunities; working with VR to serve
in-school youth as they transition from the secondary education

8

---
Page 9

system to postsecondary education, training and employment;
developing innovative pre-apprenticeship and youth
apprenticeship programs that lead to successful placement in
Registered Apprenticeship programs; or improving coordination
among existing programs, such as Job Corps and YouthBuild.

vi. Comprehensively serving dislocated workers impacted by
economic displacement. The variety of programs that serve
dislocated workers—Rapid Response, TAA, the WIOA
Dislocated Worker program, and UI and Reemployment
Assistance Services—should be strategically coordinated to
maximize efficient use of funds and to provide the most
comprehensive supports and services available to impacted

workers. This can include integrating data systems,
streamlining case management and assessment, and ensuring
needed job search or training services are provided.

vii. Connecting the multiple systems that address the specific needs
of individuals with barriers to employment (as defined in WIOA
sec. 3(24)), such as individuals with disabilities or English
language learners, and articulating how programs will
collaborate to provide the following:

conducting outreach activities to individuals with barriers to
o
employment;
conducting training activities for One-Stop Career Center
o
and partner staff on how to work with these populations and
the available community-based resources and Federal
resources such as the toolkit available at
https://doors.workforce3one.org/page/resources;
partnering with agencies and organizations serving specific
o
populations;
collaborating with the business sector to market the business
o
case for hiring populations with barriers;
implementing strategies to increase access to on-the-job-
o
training, mentoring, Registered Apprenticeship, life-long
learning, internship and job-shadowing opportunities;
providing educational and training services that lead to
o
career pathways opportunities and the development of talent
pipelines;
implementing strategies to improve securing a job, retaining
o
employment, and return-to-work strategies for job seekers
who are disconnected from the workforce; and
implementing designs to create a universally accessible,
o
welcoming, user-and customer-friendly environment for the
delivery of employment services, including remote services

Special Considerations for Combined State Plan Partner Programs.

The information collections for the program-specific portion of the State
plans for the Combined State Plan partner programs will continue to exist
under existing state planning ICRs for those programs, as governed by
those programs’ authorizing legislation. Once a Combined State Plan is
approved, the State is not required to submit any other State plan to receive
federal funding for any optional program covered under that Combined
State Plan, with some exceptions described below.

Note that some of the other programs that a State may include in the
Combined State Plan currently fulfill their program-specific State planning

requirements through a separate information collection administered by the
program’s appropriate Department. For example, section 103(b)(2) of
WIOA (referring to sec. 103(a)(2)(J) and (K)) specifically allows the
employment and training activities, rather than the full program, carried out
under the CSBG Act administered by HHS and employment and training
activities funded by HUD to be included in a WIOA Combined State Plan.
Therefore, if States choose to include programs such as these in the
Combined State Plan, only the portion of the existing planning
requirements that address the employment and training activities should be
included in the Combined State Plan. States still must submit all other
required elements of a complete State Plan for those programs directly to
the relevant Departments.

Portions of the Combined State Plan covering a program or activity,
excluding those related to the core programs, are subject to approval by the
head of the Federal agency that administers such program (WIOA sec.

103(d)(2)). The portions of the Combined State Plan related to the core
programs are subject to the same approval requirements applicable to the
Unified State Plan.

States that include UI in their Combined State Plan, carried out under Title
III, Section 302 of the Social Security Act, including Sections 303(a)(8)
and (9) which govern the expenditure of funds, should submit their UI State
Quality Service Plan (SQSP) following the cycle as outlined in the current
ET Handbook No. 336, UI SQSP Planning and Reporting Guidelines.

The Jobs for Veterans State Grant (JVSG) programs, carried out under
chapter 41 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, require both a JVSG State Plan and
a separate annual application for funding. States that include the JVSG

10

---
Page 11

programs in their Combined State Plan would submit the JVSG State Plan
information in their Combined State Plan, and would submit their funding
applications annually, as required by current VETS guidance.

For Combined State Plans, the common elements of the State Plan and
those portions covering the core programs and programs administered by
DOL or ED, will be considered approved 90 days after receipt, unless
either Secretary informs the State in writing, during the 90-day period, that
the plan is inconsistent with WIOA’s State Plan requirements or the
requirements authorizing the core program, as appropriate. Those portions
of the plan covering programs administered by HUD, USDA and HHS
must be approved or disapproved within 120 days of receipt by those
Departments. For the six core programs, decisions regarding approval or

disapproval and funding status may be determined separately from the
determination of approval, disapproval, or completeness of the program-
specific requirements of Combined State Plan partner programs and
activities described in the Combined State Plan. For example, if all the
common planning elements and program-specific requirements for the core
programs are met, approval and funding may proceed regardless of specific
issues that may be identified in the program-specific sections for any
Combined State Plan partner programs.

Stakeholder Collaboration and Comment is Key

Stakeholder collaboration, review and comment are key requirements of
the planning process. State Workforce Development Boards are
responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and
modification of the plan, and for convening all relevant programs, required
partners, and stakeholders. The State Plan must be developed with the
assistance of the State Board, as required by sec. 101(d) of WIOA, and
must be developed in coordination with administrators that have optimum
policymaking authority for the core programs and required One-Stop
partners. For Combined State Plans, entities responsible for planning or

administering other programs included in the plan also must have an
opportunity for review and comment.

Effective joint planning is fundamental to both Unified and Combined
State Plans. Whether the State chooses to submit a Unified State Plan or a
Combined State Plan, the State must develop the State Plan through joint
planning and coordination across core programs, and with required One-
Stop partner programs and other programs and activities in the State Plan.
Prior to submitting the Unified or Combined State Plan, the State agencies
responsible for the administration of the core programs must have reviewed
and commented on the appropriate operational planning portion of the State
Plan, and approved the elements as meeting the needs of the population
served by such programs (see WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(E)(iii)(I)).

11

---
Page 12

States must provide the opportunity for public comment, which allows
interested stakeholders to participate actively, effectively, and transparently
in the development of the plan. The Governor must ensure that the State
Plan is developed with an opportunity for public comment and input from
representatives of Local Boards and chief elected officials; businesses,
labor organizations, economic development entities; community-based
organizations; adult and youth education and workforce development
providers; institutions of higher education, disability service entities; youth-
serving programs; veterans’ service organizations; foster care, juvenile
justice and other stakeholders with an interest in the services provided by
the six core programs and any optional program included in a Combined
State Plan, and the general public, including individuals with disabilities.

See WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II). Programs included in the Combined
State Plan may require consultation with other specific individuals or
groups. The State Board must also make information regarding State
planning publicly available by holding regular open meetings (WIOA sec.
101(g)).

Instructions for Plan Submission

For the initial four-year Unified and Combined State Plans (covering the
period July 1, 2016-June 30, 2020), States must submit their Unified or
Combined State Plans to the Departments by March 3, 2016; however,
Plans submitted by April 1, 2016, will be considered timely.3 States must
submit the Plans via the online portal hosted by the Rehabilitation Services
Administration (RSA), which allows the entire State Plan to be available
concurrently to DOL and ED, as well as other Departments if their
programs are included. The submission portal is available along with other
State Plan resources at
https://rsa.ed.gov/login.cfm?mode=form&usp=Y#skipnav. Instructions on
how to request State user accounts are available on the web link provided
on this site. The Departments will provide training on the portal to State
users, and Federal staff will be available to provide basic technical

guidance and to authorize individuals from the States to have read-only,
and/or edit access to the State Plan portal, as appropriate.

The portal will permit multiple users within a State to enter portions of the
State’s plan at the same time, thereby allowing program partners to enter
content that is common to all State plan partners, as well as content that is
specific to their program directly. In States where there is a separate VR
program serving the blind, each VR program must complete a separate VR
services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan. Once State users

Page 13

enter all data and text into the portal, they may review the plan in its
entirety, make edits and updates where needed, and view progress in
entering plan information across programs. While multiple individuals in
the State may enter content into the portal, only one individual may submit
the entire plan on behalf of all included programs through the portal for
Federal review. The portal includes a certification that the official State
“submitter” has the authority to do so.

States that include the Perkins program as part of their Combined State
Plans will submit to the WIOA State Plan Portal their currently approved
Perkins State Plan, including any revisions the State determines are
necessary. The portal will then redirect States from the WIOA State Plan
Portal via a link to the Perkins State Plan portal. On the Perkins State Plan

portal, States will submit: (1) Request to Extend Perkins State Plan; (2)
updated budget, and (3) proposed performance levels for the upcoming
program year. ED will provide State Career and Technical Education
Directors training, passwords, and technical support to upload their
information into the WIOA State Plan portal and the Perkins State Plan
portal.

States that include Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
Employment and Training (E&T) as part of their Combined State Plan will
submit their SNAP E&T specific State Plans into the WIOA State Plan
portal, but must submit component details, participant levels, operating
budget and fiscal year planned program costs to their Food and Nutrition
Service (FNS) Regional Office.

Performance Negotiations

Separately, DOL and ED will disseminate joint guidance on the WIOA
performance negotiation process. For the first Plan, the Departments will
work with States during the negotiation process to establish the adjusted
levels of performance for each of the primary indicators for the core
programs. If necessary, some may be adjusted after the release of the final

regulation and Joint Performance ICR. Additionally, DOL and ED
acknowledge that for some indicators for certain core programs there is
insufficient, or no historical data available on which to build the required
statistical adjustment model and consequently establish levels of
performance using the statistical model as part of the negotiation process.
Therefore, DOL and ED will use a “phased-in” approach to set levels of
performance for certain indicators for certain programs. The appendix in
the Unified and Combined State Plan ICR discussed in the Unified and
Combined State Plan Options section of this PD and in Attachment II of
this PD reflects this approach and displays which indicators/programs DOL
and ED have proposed to negotiate for PY 2016. See Attachment II of this
PD for more instructions on establishing performance levels and acceptable
baseline indicators.

State Plan Modifications

Given the multi-year life of the State Plan, States must revisit State Plan
strategies regularly, reassess their effectiveness and labor market relevance,
and, where needed, recalibrate these strategies to respond to the changing
economic conditions and workforce needs of the State. At a minimum,
States must submit a modification to the Unified or Combined State Plan at
the end of the first two-year period of any four-year plan, and under
specific circumstances described in sec. 102(c)(3)(A) of WIOA.

The Departments have determined that for any Combined State Plan
program included in the plan with a different planning cycle from WIOA,
States should submit program-specific modifications that align with the
natural planning cycles for that specific program, unless the 2-year WIOA
modification cycle can accommodate that program’s planning and

modification cycle. For example, if a State chooses to include Career and
Technical Education Programs under the Perkins Act, as a part of its
Combined State Plan, the State would submit program-specific plan
modifications annually to align with the Perkins Act’s annual State plan
cycle. Such modifications must be submitted to the relevant Secretary for
that program directly, in addition to DOL and ED via the web portal. As
another example, the TANF law requires a State to have submitted a plan
within 27 months of the end of the first fiscal quarter in order to receive
TANF funds for that fiscal year. Therefore, adopting the more frequent 2-
year WIOA cycle for modifications should accommodate TANF’s cycle,
allowing a State to make all changes to each portion of the Combined State
Plan concurrently. In its Combined State Plan, the State may choose to
describe in the State Plan the planning cycles of the Combined State Plan
programs. In addition, the State may describe intentions to submit future
modifications to comply with those planning cycles. HHS intends to
publish separate guidance that outlines how a State could align its WIOA
and TANF plan renewal cycles.

Special Instructions for Single-Area States
Item VI (d) in the Title I program-specific State Plan requirements (in the

Unified and Combined State Plan ICR discussed in the Unified and
Combined State Plan Options section of this PD) is directed at Single-Area
States. It requires them to “submit any information required in the local
plan” with the submission of its State Plan. DOL is exercising its transition
authority provided in WIOA sec. 503 to delay the requirement that Single-
Area States include a local plan with their initial four-year State Plan
submission until DOL provides guidance to those specific States.

Instructions: Performance Goals for the Core Programs

Each State submitting a Unified or Combined Plan is required to identify expected levels of
performance for each of the primary indicators of performance for the first two years covered by
the plan. The State is required to reach agreement with the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction
with the Secretary of Education on state adjusted levels of performance for the indicators for each

of the first two years of the plan. To effect an orderly transition to the performance accountability
system in Section 116 of the WIOA, the Departments will use the transition authority under
WIOA sec. 503(a) to designate certain primary indicators of performance as “baseline” indicators
in the first plan submission. A “baseline” indicator is one for which States will not propose an
expected level of performance in the plan submission and will not come to agreement with the
Departments on adjusted levels of performance. “Baseline” indicators will not be used in the end
of the year performance calculations and will not be used to determine failure to achieve adjusted
levels of performance for purposes of sanctions. The selection of primary indicators for the
designation as a baseline indicator is made based on the likelihood of a state having adequate data
on which to make a reasonable determination of an expected level of performance and such a
designation will vary across core programs.

States are expected to collect and report on all indicators, including those that that have been
designated as “baseline”. The actual performance data reported by States for indicators
designated as “baseline” in the first two years of the Unified or Combined Plan will serve as
baseline data in future years.

Each core program must submit an expected level of performance for each indicator, except for
those indicators that are listed as “baseline” indicators below.

For the first Plan, the Departments will work with States during the negotiation process to
establish the adjusted levels of performance for each of the primary indicators for the core
programs. If necessary, some may be adjusted after the release of the final regulation and Joint
Performance ICR.

ATTACHMENT III

Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity
Information System (FAPIIS) Notice

On July 22, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget issued final guidance, 80 FR 43301, that
amends 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Guidance) to implement the requirement that Federal agencies
review information available in FAPIIS, the Federal government’s designated integrity and
performance system, prior to issuing new grant awards. The Department is also required to
report to FAPIIS information about existing awards that are terminated on or after January 1,
2016, due to material failure to comply with Federal award terms and conditions.

In accordance with these requirements, if your State Plan is approved and the total award amount,

for this fiscal year, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000), the
following applies under 2 CFR 200.205(a)(2):

Before the award is made, the Department will review and consider any information about
your agency that is in FAPIIS, which is accessible through the System for Award
Management (SAM). You may review and comment on any information about your
agency that may have been entered previously and that is currently in FAPIIS. In making a
judgment about your agency’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under
Federal awards – and, thus, in making our final determination of any risk posed by your
agency as a grantee – the Department will consider the information in FAPIIS, including
any comments made by you.

• 2. 2 CFR part 200 Appendix XII requires agencies to report to FAPIIS any information about
criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new
information to provide. This disclosure applies if the total value of your agency’s
currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from the

Federal Government, including any funds received under this State Plan, exceeds
$10,000,000. Please review the specific requirements in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix XII,
for greater details regarding this reporting obligation if your agency receives Federal funds
exceeding the $10,000,000 threshold.

Grant Award Notification Access
The Department may mail you a Grant Award Notification (GAN); or send you an email
containing a link to access the GAN in G5, the Department’s Grant Management System. The
email will be sent to both the Recipient State Director and the Authorizing Representative in order
for them to view and print the PDF version of the electronically signed GAN. If neither the
Recipient State Director nor Authorizing Representative is registered in G5, they will
immediately be prompted to register once the link is accessed. The electronic signature and
issuance of the GAN makes it crucial that you provide correct email addresses for both the
Recipient State Director and Authorizing Representative.
