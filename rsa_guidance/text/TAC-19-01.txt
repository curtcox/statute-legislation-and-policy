SUBJECT: Guidance for Validating Jointly Required Performance Data Submitted
under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)

PURPOSE:

This Technical Assistance Circular (TAC) provides information to States and grantees of the
U.S. Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED) (collectively “the Departments”) on the
performance accountability system requirements set forth in section 116 of WIOA. This
guidance provides information about the guidelines States must use in developing procedures for
ensuring the data submitted are valid and reliable, as required by section 116(d)(5) of WIOA.

With this issuance, the Departments update the guidance to align it with changes made by the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Effectiveness in Serving Employers Performance

Indicator final rule (89 FR 13814 (Feb. 23, 2024)) (Final Rule), which took effect March 25,
This Final Rule defined the Effectiveness in Serving Employers primary indicator of
performance, as required by WIOA section 116(b)(2), as Retention with the Same Employer, and
it requires States to report the indicator as a shared indicator across the six core programs.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:

Background

This TAC rescinds and replaces TAC-19-01, issued December 18, 2018. The revisions ensure
that the portions of the guidance related to the Effectiveness in Serving Employers performance
indicator align with the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Effectiveness in Serving
Employers joint performance indicator required by section 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(VI) of WIOA. The
performance indicator is defined as Retention with the Same Employer (89 FR 13814, Feb. 23,
2024).

Section 116 of WIOA establishes performance accountability indicators and performance

reporting requirements to assess the effectiveness of States and local areas in achieving positive

1

outcomes for participants served by the workforce development system’s six core programs.1
WIOA provides an opportunity to align performance-related definitions, streamline performance
indicators, integrate reporting, and ensure comparable data collection and reporting across all six
core programs, while also requiring the collection and reporting of program-specific data.

Through this guidance, the Departments clarify the performance accountability guidelines
required to be developed under WIOA section 116. This guidance provides States with a general
framework for data validation. Specifically, the Departments have developed this guidance
pursuant to WIOA section 116(d)(5), which requires the Departments to establish data validation
guidelines to ensure the information contained in program reports is valid and reliable. States
must develop data validation procedures consistent with WIOA section 116(d)(5).

Joint Data Validation Framework

Data validation is a series of internal controls or quality assurance techniques established to
verify the accuracy, validity, and reliability of data. Establishing a joint data validation
framework based on a consistent approach shared by the Departments will ensure that all
program data are consistent and accurately reflect the performance of each core program in each
State. To that end, the purposes of validation procedures for jointly required performance data
are to:

• • Verify that the performance data reported by States to the Departments are valid,
accurate, reliable, and comparable across programs;
• • Identify anomalies in the data and resolve issues that may cause inaccurate reporting;
• • Outline source documentation required for common data elements; and
• • Improve program performance accountability through the results of data validation

efforts.

While States must utilize a data validation strategy, the specific design, implementation, and
periodic evaluation of that strategy is left to the discretion of the State so long as those strategies
or procedures are consistent with these guidelines.

Data validation helps ensure the accuracy of the annual statewide performance reports,
safeguards data integrity, and promotes the timely resolution of data anomalies and inaccuracies.
As such, the Departments recommend that States incorporate their data validation procedures
into their internal control procedures, which are required by 2 CFR §200.303. State VR agencies
should also consider related guidance issued in RSA-DCL-23-04, dated September 28, 2023.

1 The six core programs are the Adult program, Dislocated Worker program, and Youth program, authorized under WIOA title I
and administered by DOL; the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program, authorized under WIOA title II and
administered by ED; the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III
and administered by DOL; and the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, as amended by WIOA title IV and administered by ED.

In accordance with section 116(d)(5) of WIOA, each State must develop data validation
procedures that include:

• • Written procedures for data validation that contain a description of the process for
identifying and correcting errors or missing data, which may include electronic data
checks;
• • Regular data validation training for appropriate program staff (e.g., at least annually);
• • Monitoring protocols, consistent with 2 CFR §200.328, to ensure that program staff
are following the written data validation procedures and take appropriate corrective

action if those procedures are not being followed;
• • A regular review of program data (e.g., quarterly) for errors, missing data, out-of-
range values, and anomalies;
• • Documentation that missing and erroneous data identified during the review process
have been corrected; and
• • Regular assessment of the effectiveness of the data validation process (e.g., at least
annually) and revisions to that process as needed.

The Departments also will conduct data validation to verify data accuracy once States submit
their performance reports.

Source Documentation for Common Data Elements

Procedures developed by the States must include regular data element validation through core
program monitoring on 25 common data elements, consistent with the requirements of both
section 116(d)(5) of WIOA and the internal controls requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.303. The
Departments selected these elements based on their importance for reporting accurate
performance outcomes and to ensure data consistency across core programs. The Departments
encourage States to implement a sampling methodology of their participant files and conduct file
reviews of data elements against source documentation. In Attachment I of this guidance, the
Departments identify acceptable source documentation for validating these selected data
elements. States may: (1) maintain supporting documentation for program-specific data elements
not included in this joint guidance; (2) conduct additional source document validation on more
data elements; and (3) require additional source documentation in their procedures.

States may only use self-attestation or self-reported supplemental wage data information from
participants through follow-up if all efforts to collect other allowable source documentation have
been exhausted.

Each Department will, as necessary, issue further program-specific guidelines regarding data

validation and provide program-specific statutory compliance assistance to States and grantees.
In addition, DOL will issue guidance on source documentation requirements for the DOL-only
Participant Individual Record Layout (PIRL) data elements.

Source Document Validation Instructions

The attached data element source documentation table lists the 25 common data elements that States must validate in accordance with the guidelines
established by the Departments pursuant to section 116(d)(5) of WIOA. The table displays the PIRL and RSA-911 data element numbers, data
element names, formats, definitions, instructions, and source documentation needed to perform data element validation on each data element.
Additionally, the Departments have provided a list of acceptable source documents to validate these selected 25 data elements. States and grantees
may conduct additional source document validation on more data elements, as each State and local program deems appropriate. Each program may
also implement additional source document requirements on program-specific data elements. However, all State and local programs reporting
performance data pursuant to 116(d)(5) of WIOA must use the same data element definitions in the PIRL and must use data validation procedures

developed by the State that are consistent with the guidelines identified in this joint guidance.

TYPES OF SOURCE DOCUMENTATION

The validation guidelines provide multiple forms of acceptable source documentation. Source documentation must match the reported data. If
multiple sources conflict, the most authoritative source should be used to determine if the data element is valid and accurate.

These source documentation types include:

Cross-Match: A cross-match requires grantees to identify detailed evidence that confirms the data element in a secondary database. Grantees
must also confirm supporting information, such as dates of participation and services rendered. Grantees must have data sharing agreements
in place as appropriate. Upon request, results must be available to federal auditors.

Self-Attestation: Self-attestation means a written, or electronic/digital declaration of information for a particular data element, signed and
dated by the participant. The Departments broadly interpret what is considered an electronic/digital signature. Electronic signatures or a
submission from the participant such as an email, text, or unique online participant/exiter response is considered an electronic signature or

verification; it must be participant generated and traceable to the participant. Grantees must retain documentation of self-attestations provided
by participants.

Case Notes: Case notes refer to either paper or electronic statements by the case manager or program staff that identify, at a minimum, the
following: (a) a participant's situation status related to a specific data element, (b) the date on which the information was obtained, and (c) the
name of the case manager or program staff who obtained the information.

4.Electronic Records which may include:

• • Participant Source Documents: Participant source documents maintained in the grantee’s management information system (MIS) or
other official record keeping system.

• • Grantee participant service record: Grantee participant information generated and maintained by the grantee regarding the specific
services received by a participant. The information may be generated and maintained through the grantee’s MIS or other official
recordkeeping system.
