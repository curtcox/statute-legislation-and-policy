Enforcing%20the%20Regulatory%20Reform%20Agenda%20%28EO%2013777%29%20Letter

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES

On February 24, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13777, “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform
Agenda,” which established a Federal policy “to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens” on the American
people. In accordance with the Executive Order, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) published
a notice in the Federal Register on June 22, 2017, seeking input on regulations and guidance that may be
appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification. The deadline for submitting input was September 20,
I am pleased to provide an update on the work that the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative
Services (OSERS) has been doing since the President’s Executive Order, and the closing of the public input
period.

OSERS is currently reviewing regulations and guidance in phases, which includes analyzing the input
submitted by the public. The first phase involved reviewing guidance that OSERS has published on the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehab. Act), as

amended. Initially, we evaluated the guidance to determine those that were outdated, unnecessary, or
ineffective. At this time, OSERS has a total of 72 guidance documents that have been rescinded due to
being outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective—63 from the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP)
and 9 from the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA).

Attached is a chart that includes the guidance OSERS published on the IDEA and the Rehab. Act., which
have been rescinded due to being outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective.

I encourage you to visit the Department’s website to review the Department's Regulatory Reform Task
Force's progress report. The Department is committed to an open and transparent process, and I will send
periodic updates on the progress OSERS is making with the regulatory reform efforts.

Thank you for the work you do every day to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities.

Kimberly M. Richey
Acting Assistant Secretary
