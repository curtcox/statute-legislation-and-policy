POLICY DIRECTIVE
RSA-PD-20-01
DATE: January 7, 2020

ADDRESSEES: State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies

SUBJECT: Announcement of OMB Approval for Form RSA-7-OB, Independent
Living Services for Older Individuals who are Blind Program
• (ILOIB) Annual Report

POLICY:

Through this Policy Directive (PD), the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is
transmitting a copy of the revised RSA-7-OB form for the ILOIB program. The Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) has approved an extension with changes to this information
collection (OMB control number 1820-0608) until December 31, 2022.

Background

The ILOIB program provides independent living services to persons age 55 or older who are
blind or visually impaired. RSA uses this form to meet the specific data collection requirements
of Chapter 2 of Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV of the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), and implementing regulations at 34
C.F.R. Part 367. Each designated State agency (DSA) that administers the ILOIB program is
required to submit the RSA-7-OB form annually to the RSA Commissioner on or before
December 31.

The recently approved RSA-7-OB form and instructions have streamlined and clarified some of
the items in the previous information collection. In addition, this form collects data on five
program measures that will assist RSA with more accurate measurement of the performance of
the ILOIB program. Training will be provided in the near future to help agencies implement
this revised information collection.

Implementation Timeline

For Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2020, DSAs should continue to use the previously approved
RSA-7-OB form to collect and report data no later than December 31, 2020. Beginning with
FFY 2021, which begins on October 1, 2020, DSAs must use the revised RSA-7-OB form and
instructions (see attached); these data must be reported to RSA by December 31, 2021.

active and that they have access to the RSA-7-OB form in the portal. Instructions for users are

B. OIB Program Expenditures in Reported FFY

In this section, report allowable expenditures made in support of the
OIB program in the reported FFY. For the purpose of this data
collection, the term ”expenditures” means charges made by a non-
Federal entity to the Federal OIB award (2 C.F.R. § 200.34).

In this data collection, expenditures are to be reported under two
categories, (1) administrative costs, and (2) direct service costs.
Within these categories, funds expended from the Title VII-Chapter 2
Federal OIB grant award and from non-Federal funds used to meet the
match requirement in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 367.31(b) and

4

---
Page 5

§ 367.61 are reported separately from allowable OIB expenditures made
from other Federal and non-Federal sources. However, OIB grantees
remain responsible for tracking specific information related to the
expenditure of OIB funds from each source. For example, specific
information on expenditures made from the OIB Federal award and from
non-Federal sources used in meeting the match requirement must be
reported on the SF-425.
Funds expended for administrative costs in the reported FFY - Enter
the total amount of funds expended for administrative costs,
including administrative support staff and general overhead costs,
during the reported FFY. Do not include expenditures for direct
services provided by agency staff or the expenditures of contract or

sub-grants. For example, if an administrator spends a portion of
his or her time providing administrative services and the remainder
providing direct services, include only the expenditures for
administrative services.

grant award funds, including allowable carryover funds from the

requirement as reported on line 10j of the SF-425.

Federal grant award, including allowable carryover funds from the
previous FFY and (2) non-Federal sources used in meeting the match
requirement as reported on line 10j of the SF-425.

• b. Direct service expenditures from all other allowable sources as
identified in Part I - A above.

Part II: Program Staffing

Base all full-time equivalent (FTE) calculations on the number of
hours per week considered full time for the position. Record all FTEs
assigned to the OIB program during the reported FFY irrespective of
whether salary is paid with Title VII-Chapter 2 funds. Report the
number of hours per week that define FTE for State Agency staff and
for Contract/Subgrant staff (e.g. 40 hours, 35 hours, etc.).
A. Full-time Equivalent (FTE) Program Staff

Record the FTE administrative and support staff and direct service
staff, including State agency staff and contract/subgrant staff, for
the OIB program. If a staff member provides both administrative and
support functions and direct services, report the percentage of FTE
devoted to administrative and support activities under “Administrative
& Support” and the percentage of FTE devoted to direct services under
“Direct Services.” For example, assuming a full-time 40 hour work
week, if 20% (8 hours per week) of a staff person’s time was spent on
administrative and support functions related to this program, and 80%
(32 hours per week) of the staff person’s time was spent in providing
direct services for this program, the reported FTE for that staff
person would be 0.2 for administrative and support functions and 0.8
for direct services.

individuals whose functional capabilities have been lost or diminished
as a result of vision loss or blindness.

A. Assistive Technology Devices and Services
Measure A – The percentage of individuals receiving assistive
technology devices and services who demonstrated improvement in one or

Page 18

B. Independent Living and Adjustment Training Services
Measure B - The percentage of individuals receiving one or more
independent living and adjustment training services who demonstrated
improvement in functional capabilities during the reported FFY.

C. Independence in the Home and Community
Measure C1 – The percentage of individuals completing a plan of
services who reported feeling more confident in their ability to
maintain their current living situation.

Measure C2 - The percentage of individuals completing a plan of
services who reported an increased ability to engage in their
customary daily life activities in the home and community.

• D. Efficiency Measure – (Measure will be calculated by RSA using MIS
data reported in PARTS I and III)
Objective: To provide cost effective supports and services to increase
the independence of older individuals who are blind so that they may
remain in the community and to prevent or delay the need for an
increasing level of care, particularly for those individuals who are
at risk of entering institutions.
Measure D – The average annual cost per individual served through the
program during the reported FFY.

Instructions for Reporting of Performance Data in Part V:
For measures A, Assistive Technology Devices and Services, and B,
Independent Living and Adjustment Training Services, data is reported
for individuals whose change in functional capabilities was assessed
during the reported FFY, following the receipt of one or more services
provided through the program.
For measures under C, Independence in the Home and Community, data is
reported for individuals completing a plan of services during the
reported FFY. For the purpose of this measure, “a plan of services is
a set of services provided through the OIB program designed to meet an
individual’s goals.” For the purpose of the items reported under C,
an individual who has completed his or her plan of services does not
need to have formally exited the program.

Grantees are not required to report data for efficiency measure D in
Part V. The average annual cost per individual served through the
program during the reported FFY will be calculated by RSA based on
data reported in Part I, B3 and Part III, A3.
