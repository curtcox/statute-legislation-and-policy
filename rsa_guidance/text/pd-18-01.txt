POLICY DIRECTIVE
RSA-PD-18-01
DATE: August 3, 2018

ADDRESSEES: STATE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AGENCIES

SUBJECT: Instructions for completing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for the
State Supported Employment Services program (CFDA 84.187A).

POLICY
STATEMENT: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires that grantees use
the SF-425 to report financial data for grant awards. Through this Policy
Directive (PD), the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is
transmitting a copy of the SF-425 and revised instructions for completing
the form for the portion of the State’s Supported Employment Services
(Supported Employment) allotment not required to be reserved and
expended for youth with the most significant disabilities (CFDA
84.187A).

Previously, instructions for completing the SF-425 for the Supported
Employment program were included in RSA-PD-15-06, issued on March
12, 2015. Given the issuance of two separate Supported Employment grant

awards beginning in Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2018—necessary for States
to accurately report the 10 percent non-Federal share required to match
funds reserved for the provision of supported employment services,
including extended services, to youth with the most significant disabilities
(34 C.F.R. § 363.22)—RSA has determined it necessary to develop
separate sets of SF-425 instructions specific to the two separate Supported
Employment grant awards, transmitted in this PD and in PD-18-02 for
State Supported Employment Services, including extended services,
provided to youth with the most significant disabilities. As a result, for
purposes of the Supported Employment program, this PD and PD-18-02
supersede RSA-PD-15-06.

For your convenience, the revisions to RSA-PD-15-06 instructions
applicable to this PD:
• • Update the applicable OMB approval number for the SF-425

report and Paperwork Burden Statement;

1

Page 2

• • Remind grantees to maintain a hard copy of the signed SF-425
report for verification purposes;
• • Remove requirements in line 10i - Total Recipient Share Required,
10j - Recipient Share of Expenditures, and 10k - Remaining
Recipient Share to Be Provided, which are only applicable to the
Federal funds reserved for supported employment services,
including extended services, to youth with the most significant
disabilities (34 C.F.R. § 363.23(a));
• • Remove grantee’s ability to enter data in line 10m - Program
Income Expended in Accordance with the Deduction Alternative,

as this method is no longer an option for expending program
income under the Supported Employment program (34 C.F.R.
§ 363.24(b)(2));
• • Remove an incorrect reference to 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(5), and
clarify that program income must be disbursed within the period of
performance of the award, prior to requesting additional Federal
cash draws from the Supported Employment award (34 C.F.R.
§ 363.24(b)(1));
• • Remove line 12a - Expenditures for Youth with the Most
Significant Disabilities because it is no longer necessary to report
this data element now that grant award funds required to be
reserved are allotted separately;
• • Clarify in line 12b - Administrative Costs for Supported

Employment Program that Administrative expenditures are limited
to 2.5 percent of the total amount of the State’s Supported
Employment allotment (CFDA 84.187A + CFDA 84.187B) and
that States may only use Supported Employment funds for
administrative costs from the Supported Employment CFDA
84.187A award;
• • Remove line 12c - Not applicable;
• • Create a new line 12c - SSA Program Income Transferred from
VR Program, which had previously been reported on line 12e; and
• • Remove line 12d - Recipient Share of Unliquidated Obligations as
the non-Federal share requirement is only applicable to the
allotment for Supported Employment services to youth with the
most significant disabilities (34 C.F.R. § 363.23(a)).

RSA uses the SF-425 data to monitor the financial status of the Supported
Employment program and to assess grantee compliance with the fiscal
requirements contained in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and the Supported
Employment program regulations in 34 C.F.R. part 363. Therefore, the
reports must be accurate and submitted timely.

Grantees must submit completed SF-425 reports on an annual basis. The
end date for the reporting period is September 30. Annual reports must be

2

---
Page 3

submitted no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. Final
reports must be submitted no later than 90 days after the period of
performance. The period of performance is the time during which the non-
Federal entity may incur new obligations to carry out the work authorized
under the Federal award.

Obligations made during the period of performance may be liquidated at
any point during the liquidation period, which ends 90 days after the
period of performance. If, however, the timing of liquidating obligations
precludes submission of the final SF-425 within 90 days following the
period of performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request in
accordance with the Department of Education’s Policy Memorandum
regarding extension of liquidation periods. If the late liquidation request is

approved, the grantee must submit the final SF-425 after the funds have
been liquidated, but no later than 30 days after the end of the extension
period.

Agencies are responsible for having internal controls necessary to ensure
the SF-425 data is accurate and reliable upon submission to RSA.
Agencies may request, through the RSA management information system,
that a SF-425 report be opened for revision. The RSA Financial
Management Specialist assigned to the agency will review the request and,
if necessary, place the form in an edit status to permit changes.

Electronic Submission

Reports must be submitted electronically through the RSA website. As is
done for other reports submitted to RSA electronically, grantees should
maintain a hardcopy of the report for verification purposes, signed by the

certifying official who is authorized to legally bind the non-Federal entity.
By certifying the report, the grantee is certifying that it is aware that any
false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material
fact, may subject it to “criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud,
false statements, false claims or otherwise” (2 C.F.R. § 200.415).

SF-425 FORM: STATE SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM
REPORTING MANUAL

While the SF-425 report is designed for single grant and multiple grant award reporting, the U.S.
Department of Education’s (Department) policy is that multiple grant award reporting is not
permitted for Department grants. The SF-425 attachment (SF-425A), which is to be used for

reporting multiple grants, is not to be used for Department grants and is not included with this
PD. As such, references to multiple grant reporting and to the SF-425A in items 2, 5, and 10 of
the SF-425 are not applicable to Department grantees. The Department requires grantees to
complete a separate SF-425 for each grant they receive.

Federal Agency and Organizational Element to Which Report is Submitted:
Data entry is not required for this field. RSA is the default entry.

Federal Grant or Other Identifying Number Assigned by Federal Agency:
Data entry is not required for this field. The grantee’s grant award number is the default
entry. This is the Award Number listed in Box 2 of the Grant Award Notification (GAN).
The grant award number is also referred to as the Federal Award Identification Number
(FAIN). If the information on the form is not correct, please notify the RSA Financial
Management Specialist assigned to your agency.

Recipient Organization:

Data entry is not required for this field. The organization’s name and address associated
with the grant will be the default entry. This is the organization information listed in Box 1
of the GAN. If the information on the form is not correct, please notify the RSA Financial
Management Specialist assigned to your agency.

4a. DUNS Number:
Data entry is not required for this field. The Grantee Data Universal Numbering System
• (DUNS) number associated with the grant will be the default entry. This is the DUNS
number listed in Box 8 of the GAN. If the information on the form is not correct, please
notify the RSA Financial Management Specialist assigned to your agency.

4b. EIN:
Data entry is not required for this field. The Employer Identification Number (EIN)
associated with the grantee will be the default entry. This number is also known as the Tax
Identification Number (TIN). If the information on the form is not correct, please notify the
RSA Financial Management Specialist assigned to your agency.

Recipient Account Number or Identifying Number:
This is an optional data element. Enter an account number or any other identifying number
assigned by the grantee to the award. This number is for the grantee’s use only and is not
required by RSA. Data entry is limited to 30 characters.

8

---
Page 9

Report Type:
Indicate if the report is final. A report can be marked as final prior to the end of the period of
performance if the grantee has liquidated its obligations and no additional reporting is
required for the grant award. The final report must indicate that Federal obligations have
been liquidated. There should be no cash on hand and program income must be disbursed.

Basis of Accounting (Cash/Accrual):
Specify whether a cash or accrual basis was used for recording transactions related to the
grant award and for preparing the SF-425. For cash basis accounting, expenses are recorded
when they are paid. Accrual basis of accounting refers to the accounting method where
expenses are reported when incurred. Accrued expenditures are recorded when goods or
services are received, regardless of when cash is received or paid.

Note: A grantee can report using either a cash or accrual basis of accounting. However, if a
grantee changes from one basis to another, the grantee should inform RSA of the change.
To ensure grantees are not using separate bases of accounting for reports covering the same
FFY, changes should coincide with the end of the FFY.

Project/Grant Period (From/To):
Data entry is not required for this field. The grant period in Box 6 of the GAN is the default
entry. This data element represents the period for which the funds were awarded (34 C.F.R.
§ 77.1(c)). The Uniform Guidance uses the term “period of performance” rather than “grant
period.” Period of performance is defined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.77 in a manner similar to the
Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) definition of “grant
period.” The grant period represents the period for which the funds were awarded in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 77.1. The grant period is one year. However, Federal funds
that remain unobligated at the end of the year of appropriation under CFDA 84.187A may
be carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY (Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act,
and 34 C.F.R. § 76.709) only to the extent that the agency complied with the applicable

matching requirement for the Supported Employment (CFDA 84.187B) award (the 10
percent match requirement for the funds reserved for the provision of Supported
Employment services, including extended services, to youth with the most significant
disabilities) for the FFY in which the funds were awarded (sections 19 and 606(b)(7)(I) of
the Rehabilitation Act, 34 C.F.R. § 363.23(a)(2) and 34 C.F.R. § 76.709).

During the FFY of appropriation, the Federal Funding Period listed in Box 6 of the GAN
will be from October 1 to September 30 of that FFY. This represents the one-year period for
which the award is made and in which the grantee may incur new obligations against the
award. Section 19(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act permits grantees to carry over Federal
funds for obligation and expenditure in the subsequent FFY provided certain conditions are
met. Upon submission of the grantee’s fourth quarter SF-425s (which is the reporting period
ending September 30 of the FFY of appropriation) for both Supported Employment awards,
an RSA Financial Management Specialist will review the grantee’s reports to determine
whether the grantee met requirements to carry over funds under the Supported Employment
award reserved for youth with most significant disabilities (CFDA 84.187B). In the event
the grantee met the requirements of section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act to carry over funds

9

---
Page 10

under CFDA 84.187B for an additional FFY, RSA will extend the period of performance for
the CFDA 84.187A for an additional FFY if there is an unobligated balance of Federal funds
for CFDA 84.187A as of September 30 of the year of appropriation. If the grantee does not
meet the requirements to carry over Federal funds under CDFA 84.187B, the CFDA
84.187A grant award will also not be permitted to carry over funds, regardless of the
amount of unobligated Federal funds that remain for CFDA 84.187A as of September 30 of
the year of appropriation.

Reporting Period End Date:
Data entry may be required for this field if the grantee is submitting a final report. The
default reporting period end date will correspond with the required reporting period
(September 30). The period covered is always the beginning date of the grant through the
end of the reporting period. When submitting a final SF-425 form:

• • If all funds are obligated by September 30 of the FFY in which the award was made and
liquidated within 90 days after the end of that period, the reporting period end date shall
be September 30 of the FFY in which the award was made;
• • If Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY, all funds must be
obligated by September 30 of the carryover year and liquidated within 90 days following
the period of performance, the reporting period end date for the final report shall be
September 30 of the carryover year; and
• • If Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY, a late liquidation
request extension has been approved, and funds were obligated by September 30 of the
carryover year and liquidated by the approved date for late liquidation, the reporting
period end date for the final report shall remain September 30 of the carryover year, but
the final report shall be due 30 days after the end date of the approved late liquidation
extension period.

Transactions

10a. Federal Cash Receipts:
The grantee must enter the net drawdown amount on line 10a, which is obtained by
running a G5 External Award Activity Report (https://www.g5.gov) using date
parameters.
• • For annual reports, the date parameters entered in G5 will be the start date of the
award and the reporting period end date.
• • For final reports, the date parameters entered in G5 will be the start date of the
award and the date award funds were liquidated. Because an agency may draw
down funds during the liquidation period or upon receipt of an approved late
liquidation request, the end date of the G5 External Award Activity Report may
be past the end of the period of performance of the award. This does not change

the reporting period end date listed on the SF-425.

The Federal Supported Employment net drawdown amount will be shown on the G5
report and should be entered as the amount on line 10a of the SF-425 form. Grantees
may want to maintain copies of the G5 External Award Activity Reports as

10

---
Page 11

supporting documentation that verifies the accuracy of the amount reported on line
10a.

10b. Federal Cash Disbursements:
Enter the cumulative amount of actual disbursements made from Federal Supported
Employment funds drawn down during the reporting period from line 10a.
Disbursements are the sum of actual cash expenditures made for direct charges for
goods and services, the amount of indirect expenses charged to the award, and the
amount of cash advances and payments made to contractors/vendors.

10c. Federal Cash on Hand (10a minus 10b equals 10c):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
If more than three business days of cash are on hand, RSA requires an explanation on

line 12, Remarks, explaining why the drawdown was made prematurely or other
reasons for the excess cash. Grantees must minimize the time elapsing between the
drawdown of Federal funds and disbursement by the grantee in accordance with
Federal requirements (31 C.F.R. part 205; 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(1)).

10d. Total Federal Funds Authorized:
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is updated automatically
and represents the total amount of Federal funds awarded to the grantee as of the end
of the reporting period.

10e. Federal Share of Expenditures:
Enter the amount of expenditures incurred with Federal funds (also known as Federal
fund expenditures).
• • For reports prepared on a cash basis, the agency should report Federal fund
expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and

services, the amount of indirect expenses charged, and the amount of payments
made to contractors/vendors.
• • For reports prepared on an accrual basis, grantees should report Federal fund
expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and
services, the amount of indirect expenses incurred, the amount of payments made
to contractors/vendors, and the increase or decrease in the amounts owed by the
recipient for goods received and services performed by employees,
contractors/vendors, and other payees.

Do not include Federal program income received by the grantee on line 10e. See line
10l, Total Federal Program Income Earned, for instructions regarding the reporting of
Federal program income.

10f. Federal Share of Unliquidated Obligations:
Enter the Federal portion of unliquidated obligations incurred by the grantee.

Unliquidated obligations include direct and indirect expenses for goods and services
incurred by the grantee, but not yet paid or charged to the Supported Employment

11

---
Page 12

grant award, including amounts due to contractors/vendors. When submitting a final
SF-425 report, this line should be zero.

On line 10f, do not include:
Expenditures reported on line 10e; and
Future fund commitments for which an obligation or expense has not been
incurred pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 76.707.

Note: Grantees have 90 days from the end of the period of performance to liquidate
Federal obligations (2 C.F.R. § 200.328(b)(1)), which applies regardless of whether
the grantee uses a cash or accrual basis of accounting. If the timing of liquidating
obligations precludes submission of the final SF-425 report within 90 days after the
period of performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request. The request

for late liquidation must be made in accordance with the Department’s guidance on
late liquidations. If approved, the grantee must liquidate the approved obligations and
submit the final SF-425 report within 30 days after the approved late liquidation
extension date. When submitting a final SF-425 report, line 10f should be zero.

10g. Total Federal Share (sum of 10e and 10f equals 10g):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.

10h. Unobligated Balance of Federal Funds (10d minus 10g equals 10h):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
For the final report, this represents the amount of Federal Supported Employment
program funds that the grantee did not obligate or liquidate.

10i. Total Recipient Share Required:
Data entry is not required for this field. There is no non-Federal share requirement for
funds allotted under CFDA 84.187A.

10j. Recipient Share of Expenditures:
Data entry is not required for this field.

10k. Remaining Recipient Share to Be Provided (10i minus 10j equals 10k):
Data entry is not required for this field.

10l. Total Federal Program Income Earned:

Program income includes Social Security Administration (SSA) payments that the
grantee has chosen to transfer from the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)
program to the Supported Employment program in accordance with regulations.
Program income from SSA payments recorded as received in the VR program that the
grantee has chosen to transfer to the Supported Employment program is restricted to
the grant award year that corresponds to the FFY in which it was earned in the VR
program. For example, SSA payments earned and recorded in the VR program in
FFY 2018 may be transferred to the Supported Employment program for expenditure
and reporting purposes under the FFY 2018 award. This means the transfer may occur
during the FFY 2018 grant year or, if applicable, during the FFY 2018 carryover year.

Include the amount of SSA payments recorded as received from the VR program
through a transfer in the total on line 10l and report the amount of transferred funds

separately on line 12c, Program Income Transferred from VR Program.

Program income earned may only be expended in accordance with the addition
alternative.

10m. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Deduction Alternative:
Data entry is not required for this field. The deduction method is not an allowable
option for expending program income under the Supported Employment program in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(2). The addition method is the only
permissible use of program income under the Supported Employment program.

10n. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Addition Alternative:
Enter the amount of program income that was used to supplement the Federal share of
the total program costs. The amount reported on line 10n represents actual
disbursements (i.e., outlays of program income by the grantee). The outlay of all
program income funds must meet the same standards of allowability, reasonableness

and allocability (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403, 200.404, and 200.405) that are applicable to
Federal funds (section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.307(e)(2),
200.401 and 200.408).

10o. Unexpended Program Income (10l minus 10m or 10n equals 10o):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
When submitting a final SF-425 report, this line should be zero. Program income that
has not been disbursed by the end of the liquidation period must be returned to the
Federal award.

Note: “Program income earned or received during the fiscal year must be disbursed
during the period of performance of the award, prior to requesting additional cash
payments,” in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(1).

Indirect Expense:
Indirect costs are generally charged to Federal awards through an approved indirect cost rate
or cost allocation plan (CAP). Any State grantee that wishes to claim indirect costs under

Federal grants through an indirect cost rate must prepare an indirect cost proposal and
submit it to the cognizant Federal agency for approval (2 C.F.R. part 200 – Appendix VII,
paragraph D). State grantees claiming indirect expense based on a CAP, rather than an
indirect cost rate, must develop, document, maintain for audit, or submit, as appropriate, a
narrative cost allocation methodology for indirect costs to the cognizant agency for review,
negotiation, and approval, and must follow the directions included in the line item
instructions below (2 C.F.R. part 200 – Appendix VII, paragraph F.3).
