INTRODUCTION

Employment — paid work — leads to economic opportunity, equity, and independence. Individuals with
disabilities optimize their ability to enjoy these benefits of employment through careers and jobs
available to all individuals that provide competitive earnings (wages equal to or exceeding applicable

minimum wage rates), integration (interaction with coworkers and others without disabilities similar to
that experienced by their non-disabled peers while performing their job duties), and opportunity for
advancement (i.e., “competitive integrated employment”).1 Individuals with disabilities also strengthen
their economic security through employment that provides health insurance and paid leave.
Furthermore, the employment of individuals with disabilities benefits our communities and our nation

as they maximize their skills and talents and contribute fully to our economy.

However, far too often, individuals with disabilities are unemployed, underemployed, or employed at
low wages because society often views their potential with low expectations. Community engagement,
supported by a variety of service systems, enables individuals with disabilities to expand skills and
experience so that they may secure high-quality and personally satisfying careers and jobs and the
benefits of employment.

This brief paper, targeted to both policymakers and service providers, presents a joint Federal vision for
community engagement. It describes why this vision is important and how it may lead to better
employment outcomes, as well as identifies the types of supports necessary and available through
multiple service systems to facilitate community engagement for individuals, including youth, with
disabilities. Maximizing all opportunities for community engagement through collaborative and
coordinated service planning and delivery that support personal interests and goals keeps individuals on

the path to competitive integrated employment.

1973 and 34 C.F.R. 361.5(c)(9), see frequently asked questions titled Criterion for an Integrated Employment Location in the
Definition of “Competitive Integrated Employment” and Participant Choice, published as RSA-FAQ-22-02 by the U.S.

A FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT — A PATHWAY TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT

WHAT IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT?

Community engagement means participation in activities in the community that are chosen by
individuals with disabilities and offer meaningful opportunities for learning and expanding skills critical
to employment and independent living. Community engagement leads to social interaction and the

development of personal and professional relationships. Opportunities made possible through
participating in community activities may provide a pathway to employment for young adults
transitioning to adult life and for adults who want to work, and such opportunities are an essential
complement to competitive integrated employment. For individuals seeking to improve their
employment potential, community engagement fills their day with activities and learning opportunities
that are individualized; provides a sense of purpose, meaning, and belonging; and results in sustained

relationships with others in their neighborhood and community.

Engagement in the community provides opportunities to:
• • Build relationships and social networks.

Social networks create opportunities for individuals to make connections with others and to reap
the mental health and psychological support that come from interacting with others. By
participating in social networks, individuals develop a sense of belonging in the community.
Social networks also provide an opportunity to identify people in the community who can serve
as mentors and help individuals connect with employers. Social networks often provide the

primary source of information about non-advertised job opportunities and personal connections
that enrich each individual’s work and other areas of life.
• • Sharpen workplace social skills.

By interacting with others in the community, in different environments and activities, individuals
may learn to relate to people of different ages, cultures, languages, and personalities. By
engaging in the community, individuals also may learn to advocate for themselves in work
environments.

• • Learn work skills.
Individuals may explore what kind of work would be a good job fit through direct real-world
experiences and build a resume of such experiences based on their interests and choices. This

may include volunteering or temporary work as a precursor to full- or part-time competitive
integrated employment.

There are limitless opportunities for community engagement, such as attending continuing education
classes to pursue hobbies and personal interests that also may support employment; volunteering, for
example, with a food bank or animal shelter; helping an elderly neighbor or family member; using the
computer at the library; shopping in stores; going regularly to a fitness center; and joining community

service groups and faith-based organizations; or other engagements that provide meaning and purpose
specific to the individual. Brainstorming with people who know the community may assist in identifying
a wide range of opportunities that are meaningful to the individual.

Individuals with disabilities do not need to choose between working and engaging in the community as
both may be pursued simultaneously. The amount of time each person works may vary widely—from
exploring work possibilities, to working a few hours a week, to full-time employment. Community
engagement activities provide additional opportunities for individuals with disabilities to develop skills

and competencies, gain confidence and a sense of purpose, and enhance their independence, which
helps them to work at their full potential.

While community engagement may occur throughout an individual’s lifetime, the expectation and
experiences needed to support independent living, community engagement, and employment should
start early in life and increase as individuals with disabilities mature. In the early years of life, children’s
interactions outside the home occur in the context of family. As children become more social and active

during the beginning of formal education, families, teachers, and other service providers should develop
a vision for a future of work and independence. As they enter adolescence, children should engage in
career exploration opportunities in the community that foster self-determination and individual
decision-making about their future. Work-based learning experiences, such as serving as a volunteer,
may encompass learning responsibility, developing financial literacy, traveling independently, and
developing social skills important in the work environment. These and other work-based learning and

education-related experiences may help build an individual’s resume.

To effectively expand opportunities for the employment of individuals with disabilities, community
engagement should be:

• • Individualized.
Successful community engagement activities are based on the choices, interests, strengths, and
needs of each individual with a disability. For example, a student may be interested in
participating in after-school sports or a young adult may desire to work with animals or help
people who are ill, providing opportunities that would foster engagement with others.

• • Interactive.
There is a difference between simply existing in a community and engaging in that community.

Through community engagement, individuals with disabilities interact with other community
members of the individual’s choice, including routine interactions with others who get to know
the person through shared experiences and from whom the person may learn. It provides the
individual with the opportunity to develop and strengthen a sense of purpose directed toward
personal goals based on personal preferences. For example, working with a garden club to
improve a neighborhood park, delivering meals, volunteering at an animal shelter, taking care of

a neighbor’s lawn or dog, participating in virtual service learning projects, and visiting regularly
with residents of a nursing home may help the individual develop new social and work-related
skills and open doors to paid employment. Group activities foster opportunities for individuals to
connect with others and experience a sense of accomplishment and belonging.

• • Supported.
Successful community engagement may include facilitation, coaching, and mentoring. The
service provider’s role frequently is to facilitate for individuals with disabilities access to

community activities and services consistent with their individualized goals, to provide coaching
during interactions and activities, and to connect them with others in the community who may
provide coaching and mentoring.

WHAT SERVICE SYSTEMS SUPPORT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT?

Engaging in community life requires planning and support by every service system that serves children,
youth, and adults with disabilities. Education, vocational rehabilitation, employment, workforce
development, independent living, social security, physical and behavioral health, developmental

disabilities, and other home and community-based services (HCBS) may provide complementary services
and supports. Successful outcomes require systems to work together. Purposeful and appropriate
braiding, blending, and sequencing of services and supports across these systems, to the extent
consistent with applicable laws, may enhance their seamless provision for the individual. The type,
location, and length of services needed and preferred, as well as the individual’s age and eligibility for
benefits and services, influence and help to determine the multiple service delivery systems available for

a particular individual.

For example, formal and informal assessments, such as discovery methods, may assist individuals with
identifying goals, strengths, and interests related to employment and provide a foundation for person-
centered planning. These assessments may be provided through special education, vocational
rehabilitation, and workforce systems as well as through Medicaid-funded HCBS and some mental health
services. Similarly, these same systems can provide support for eligible individuals to engage in career

exploration, work-based learning (including volunteering and service learning), and other activities
supporting the development of workplace self-advocacy, independent living, and workplace skills.

For community engagement to expand employment opportunities, service providers should coordinate
planning and service provision. This is particularly important for the success of youth transitioning from
school to post-school activities. Providers may expand opportunities for community engagement that

lead to employment opportunities in several ways. By having staff, including job developers and job
coaches, trained in customized employment strategies, providers may use discovery methods to better
understand an individual’s interests, skills, and abilities, which may lead to exploring potential
employment opportunities in their community. Once a person’s interests and employment goals are
identified, they can begin building skills and experiences through community engagement opportunities
that develop relationships with potential employers and other individuals in the community and that

may lead to employment. To support skill development related to competitive integrated employment,
community engagement also may initially involve volunteer opportunities for causes that are relevant to
the individual’s personal interests to build experience for a resume and lead to increased opportunities
for paid employment or skills that are transferrable to a new job the individual desires. One of the key
elements of community engagement is that it is focused on using the time a person spends in the

community to build relationships and be involved in activities that maximize their ability to be successful
in realizing their future competitive integrated employment goals.

subjects that interest her and activities she likes to do. The team discovered that Beth likes dogs and
often walks the family dog with her father. Beth and her community-based services agency created a
plan to offer a dog walking service in the neighborhood, including pricing out her services. The
community support staff help her schedule the week and accompany her on the walks. As word spread

and Beth’s dog walking service grew, the staff assisted Beth to visit a local bank branch to open a savings
and checking account. Staff also helped Beth to open an Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE)
account2 and begin to make regular contributions from income she receives from her dog walking
service. In addition, the day program started a peer support group of part-time workers. They talk about
their work, what they plan to do with their money, and their plans for the future. Several friends from

the program became dog walkers for Beth’s business, with Beth’s support staff assisting with the
scheduling. Beth’s social relationships grew through her dog walking business and gave her a new sense
of confidence and purpose.

Tim, an 18-year-old student with autism, wanted to work after graduating from high school. Tim’s
individualized education program (IEP) Team, including a Vocational Rehabilitation counselor, identified
work-based learning experiences for Tim in the community, such as at a local grocery store loading

purchases into cars and assisting with delivering meals through the Meals on Wheels program. These
experiences met Tim’s interests of helping others and being on the move. A daughter of a Meals on
Wheels client observed Tim’s reliability and asked if he would be interested in assisting to transport
patients at the local hospital where she worked. Tim was enthusiastic and soon started working part-
time at the hospital two afternoons per week while in school with the support of a job coach. The IEP

Team invited the local adult HCBS system representative to his IEP meetings, and they jointly planned for
his post-school transition at age 21. Tim worked with the support of his job coach and received benefits
counseling provided by his Vocational Rehabilitation agency until graduation when he was promoted to a
full-time employee with benefits with the ongoing support of a job coach from the adult social services
system.

Harry was 35 years old and had worked in a segregated work center his entire adult life where he

packaged pipe fittings all day. Harry wanted to earn more. While assisting Harry to find a job that would
meet his goal, the work center staff engaged him in the community, including transporting him to classes
at a fitness center. This activity improved Harry’s self-confidence. To increase his independence, the
center staff provided Harry with the training needed to take the bus to and from the work center and the
fitness center. The bus driver noticed Harry and suggested to center staff they assist Harry to explore a

job with the bus company. As a result, Harry started work three days per week maintaining buses at the

A FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT — A PATHWAY TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT

company’s depot. Because of the skills he learned and the interpersonal connections he made traveling
to his fitness classes, Harry expanded his opportunity for competitive integrated employment.

In summary, community engagement is a critically important pathway to competitive integrated
employment, and, in order to build capacity to expand these opportunities, policymakers and service
providers should coordinate planning and service provision through a framework that incorporates the

following principles: 1) Policymakers should focus on aligning policy, practice, funding, and performance
measures, to the extent consistent with applicable laws, to encourage and incentivize service providers
to provide the community engagement activities and other services necessary for individuals with
disabilities to achieve competitive integrated employment. 2) Service providers should focus on building
capacity to offer customized employment and other services that create a person-centered approach to

community engagement and competitive integrated employment, as well as developing relationships
with employers in the community who may help connect qualified workers with job opportunities that
match their skills and interests.

Federal and State policies and funding structures were often enacted based on the outdated and
erroneous assumption that some individuals with disabilities are incapable of working. As evidence and
progress continue to demonstrate that, with the appropriate supports and accommodations, anyone is

capable of being successful in competitive integrated employment, including those with significant
disabilities, it is incumbent upon policymakers and service providers to remove these existing systemic
barriers and implement new policies and practices that can maximize the potential of all individuals with
disabilities to have equal access to competitive integrated employment opportunities in their
community.
