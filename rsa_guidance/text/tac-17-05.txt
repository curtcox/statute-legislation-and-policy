SUBJECT: WIOA Annual Performance Report Submission

PURPOSE:

The U.S. Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED) (collectively, Departments) are
exercising their transition authority under section 503(a) of the Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act (WIOA) to inform States that the Departments will consider Program Year (PY)
2016 WIOA Statewide and Local Performance Reports (form ETA-9169) submitted by
October 16, 2017, as being timely. For all subsequent PYs, States must submit the WIOA
Statewide and Local Performance Report by October 1 to be considered timely, pursuant to the
“Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Performance Accountability, Information
and Reporting System” information collection request (WIOA Joint Performance ICR).
The WIOA Joint Performance ICR, approved under OMB Control Number 1205-0526, contains
the performance accountability reporting requirements for the core programs identified in WIOA
and authorized under:

• • WIOA title I and administered by DOL;
• • the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program, authorized under
WIOA title II and administered by ED;
• • the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended
by WIOA title III and administered by DOL; and
• • the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV and administered by ED.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:

Background

Section 116(d)(2) of WIOA requires each State to submit a State Performance Report annually.
Consistent with the WIOA Joint Performance ICR, the due date for this report is October 1 of
each year. If October 1 falls on a weekend or holiday, the report will be due on the next business
day. As required by section 116(d) of WIOA, the report covers performance data from July 1 to
June 30 of the current program year and the three preceding years. The Departments note that

some State grantees have indicated that they may have challenges meeting the October 1 due
date for the PY 2016 performance report because this will be the first performance report
submitted under the new requirements of WIOA. Therefore, the Departments are exercising their
transition authority under section 503(a) of WIOA to consider PY 2016 performance reports
submitted by October 16, 2017, as timely. The Departments have decided that this one-time
action is necessary to ensure a smooth transition from the reporting requirements of the
Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) to those under WIOA.

Each State must submit all WIOA performance reports, including (1) the annual statewide
reports, (2) as applicable, the local area performance reports, and (3) if available, links to the
Eligible Training Provider reports, to its respective Federal agency for the core programs as
follows:

• • for titles I and III, the report must be submitted to DOL’s Employment and Training
Administration, through the Workforce Integrated Performance System;
• • for title II, the report must be submitted to ED’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult
Education; and
• • for title IV, the report must be submitted to ED’s Rehabilitation Services Administration.

Sanction Provisions

In accordance with section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA, for any State that fails to report by the
due date, the Governor’s reserve authorized under section 128 of WIOA will be reduced by
5 percent. However, the Departments are exercising their transition authority under section
503(a) of WIOA and will not be imposing sanctions for those States that are not able to submit a
complete report by October 16, 2017, for the PY 2016 annual report because this will be the first

performance report submitted under the new requirements of WIOA. The Departments’ use of
the transition authority with respect to the imposition of sanctions for States that fail to submit a
complete report by October 16, 2017, does not mean that States do not have to submit the
performance reports. Rather, the Departments’ use of the transition authority ensures a smooth
transition from the performance reporting requirements under WIA to those under WIOA.
