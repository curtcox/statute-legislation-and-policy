<p>SUBJECT:       Vision for the One-Stop Delivery System under the Workforce Innovation</p>
<p>and Opportunity Act (WIOA)</p>
<p>PURPOSE:       This Technical Assistance Circular (TAC) lays out the vision for the one-
stop delivery system under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
- (WIOA) and links to key technical assistance resources to support States
and local areas as they integrate this vision into their one-stop delivery
system. Separate guidance is being issued by the Department of Labor’s</p>
<h2 id="employment-and-training-administration-and-the-department-of">Employment and Training Administration and the Department of</h2>
<h2 id="educations-office-of-career-technical-and-adult-education-to-their">Education’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education to their</h2>
<p>grantees who are partners in the workforce development system. It was
developed in collaboration with these agencies, as well as with the</p>
<h2 id="department-of-health-and-human-services-administration-for-children">Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children</h2>
<p>and Families.</p>
<p>WIOA, which was signed into law on July 22, 2014, is designed to help
job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services</p>
<p>to succeed in the labor market and to match employers with the skilled
workers they need to compete in the global economy. WIOA supersedes
titles I and II of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and amends the</p>
<h2 id="wagner-peyser-act-and-the-rehabilitation-act-of-1973">Wagner-Peyser Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</h2>
<p>The Departments of Labor and Education published a set of proposed
regulations for implementing WIOA in five Notices of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRMs) in the Federal Register on April 15, 2015, with a
60-day public comment period. The Departments will review, analyze,
and consider the thousands of comments received in response to the</p>
<h2 id="nprms-the-final-rule-will-be-published-in-2016">NPRMs. The Final rule will be published in 2016.</h2>
<p>In order to assist States in implementing the requirements of WIOA prior
to the Final rules, RSA will issue a series of operating guidance in the
form of TACs, such as this, which will assist the Vocational Rehabilitation
- (VR) agencies with the important planning and organizational work</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p>necessary to comply with the WIOA statutory requirements. The
operating guidance TACs will provide a framework for program activities
until the regulations are finalized.</p>
<h2 id="references-see-attachment-1">REFERENCES:    See Attachment 1.</h2>
<h1 id="background">BACKGROUND:</h1>
<p>The vision for the one-stop delivery system contained in this TAC reflects
the long-standing and ongoing work of dedicated workforce professionals
around the country to align a wide range of publicly and privately funded
education, employment, and training programs while also providing high-
quality customer service to job seekers, workers, and businesses through
the one-stop delivery system.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-one-stop-centers-currently-branded-as-american-job">The creation of one-stop centers (currently branded as American Job</h2>
<p>Centers) was a cornerstone of WIA when it passed in 1998. In the years
between the passage of WIA and WIOA — and longer for those
communities that piloted one-stop centers under the Job Training</p>
<p>Partnership Act of 1982 — the workforce system has tested a variety of
approaches to maximize the benefits of one-stop centers to its direct
customers and their communities. In the last 10 years, technological
advancements have opened up new avenues of service delivery, and the
increased availability of evidence-based models has strengthened our
shared understanding of the best of these approaches. In addition, the</p>
<h2 id="obama-administration-worked-intensively-with-federal-agencies-in-2013">Obama Administration worked intensively with federal agencies in 2013</h2>
<p>and 2014 to reform federal employment, education, and training programs
to create a more integrated, job-driven service delivery system. A job-
driven service delivery system is one that results in linking our nation’s
diverse talent with employers and businesses. As a result of this work,
one-stop centers continue to be a valued community resource, known both
locally and nationally as an important source of assistance for those
looking for work or workers, and those looking for opportunities to grow
their careers.</p>
<p>WIOA recognizes the value of the one-stop delivery system, and provides
the workforce system with important tools to enhance the quality of its
one-stop centers. The law strengthens the ability of States, regions, and
local areas to align investments in workforce, education, and economic
development to regional in-demand jobs. It also places greater emphasis
on achieving results for job seekers, workers, and businesses. Finally, it
reinforces the partnerships and strategies necessary for one-stop centers to
provide job seekers and workers with the high-quality career services,
education and training, and supportive services they need to obtain good
jobs and stay employed; and to help businesses find skilled workers and
access other supports, including education and training for their current
workforce.</p>

<h2 id="since-the-one-stop-delivery-system-was-established-technology-has-made">Since the one-stop delivery system was established, technology has made</h2>
<p>lasting changes to our economy and society. Mobile workers and
businesses with regional and national footprints that cross municipal
borders are much more common. For that reason, there is an increased
customer demand for consistent, high-quality education, employment, and
training services across the country. The passage of WIOA supports the
workforce system in meeting that demand, and the adoption of a national
vision for the one-stop delivery system and its one-stop centers is an
important first step in that work.</p>

<h2 id="the-publicly-funded-workforce-system-envisioned-by-wioa-is-quality-">The publicly funded workforce system envisioned by WIOA is quality-</h2>
<p>focused, employer-driven, customer-centered, and tailored to meet the
needs of regional economies. It is designed to increase access to, and
opportunities for, the employment, education, training, and support
services that individuals need to succeed in the labor market, particularly
those with barriers to employment. It aligns workforce development,
education, and economic development programs with regional economic
development strategies to meet the needs of local and regional employers,
and provide a comprehensive, accessible, and high-quality workforce
development system. This is accomplished by providing all customers
access to high-quality one-stop centers that connect them with the full
range of services available in their communities, whether they are looking
to find jobs, build basic educational or occupational skills, earn a
postsecondary certificate or degree, or obtain guidance on how to make
career choices, or are businesses and employers seeking skilled workers.</p>
<p>Under WIOA, partner programs and entities that are jointly responsible for
workforce and economic development, educational, and other human
resource programs collaborate to create a seamless customer-focused one-
stop delivery system that integrates service delivery across all programs
and enhances access to the programs’ services. The one-stop delivery
system includes six core programs (Title I adult, dislocated worker, and
youth programs; Title II adult education and literacy programs; Title III</p>
<h2 id="wagner-peyser-program-and-title-iv-vocational-rehabilitation-program">Wagner-Peyser program; and Title IV vocational rehabilitation program),</h2>

<p>implementation of partner programs in one-stop centers. For clarity and
readability the characteristics have been grouped into three functional
categories: (a) Customer Service; (b) Innovation and Service Design; and
- (c) Systems Integration and High-Quality Staffing.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. One-Stop Centers Provide Excellent Customer Service to Job</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seekers-workers-and-businesses-meeting-the-needs-of-job">Seekers, Workers, and Businesses. Meeting the needs of job</h2>
<p>seekers, workers, and businesses is important in developing thriving
communities where all citizens succeed and businesses prosper. High-
quality one-stop centers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Reflect a welcoming environment to all customer groups who are
served by the one-stop centers. All one-stop center staff are
courteous, polite, responsive, and helpful to job seekers, businesses,
and others who visit the one-stop centers, either in person or by
telephone or e-mail. Moreover, one-stop center staff are sensitive to
the unique needs of individuals with disabilities and are prepared to
provide necessary accommodations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Develop, offer, and deliver quality business services that assist
specific businesses and industry sectors in overcoming the challenges
of recruiting, retaining, and developing talent for the regional
economy. To support area employers and industry sectors most
effectively, one-stop center staff identify and have a clear
understanding of industry skill needs, identify appropriate strategies
for assisting employers, and coordinate business services activities
across one-stop center partner programs, as appropriate. This includes
the incorporation of an integrated and aligned business services
strategy among one-stop center partners to present a unified voice for
the one-stop center in its communications with employers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additionally-one-stop-centers-use-the-forthcoming-performance">Additionally, one-stop centers use the forthcoming performance</h2>
<p>measure(s) on effectiveness in serving employers to support
continuous improvement of these services.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Improve the skills of job seeker and worker customers. One-stop</li>
</ul>
<p>centers offer access to education and training leading to industry-
recognized credentials through the use of career pathways,</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>apprenticeships, and other strategies that enable customers, including
those with disabilities, to compete successfully in today’s global
economy. They provide businesses with access to the quantity and
quality of talent they need and support upskill/backfill strategies that
expand job opportunities in the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Create opportunities for individuals at all skill levels and levels of
experience by providing customers, including those with disabilities,
as much timely, labor market, job-driven information and choice as
possible related to education and training, careers, and service delivery
options, while offering customers the opportunity to receive both skill-
development and job placement services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Provide career services that motivate, support, and empower
customers, including individuals with disabilities, to make informed
decisions based on local and regional economic demand and
effectively attain their personal employment and education goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Value skill development by assessing and improving each
individual’s basic, occupational, and employability skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. One-Stop Centers Reflect Innovative and Effective Service Design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-quality-one-stop-centers">High-quality one-stop centers:</h2>
<ul>
<li>• Use an integrated and expert intake process for all customers</li>
</ul>
<p>entering the one-stop centers. Frontline staff are highly familiar with
the functions and basic eligibility requirements of each program, and
can appropriately assist customers and make knowledgeable referrals
to partner programs, as needed and as appropriate given the authorized
scope of the program.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Design and implement practices that actively engage industry
sectors and use economic and labor market information, sector
strategies, career pathways, Registered Apprenticeships, and
competency models to help drive skill-based initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Balance traditional labor exchange services with strategic talent
development within a regional economy. This includes use of
market-driven principles and labor market information that help to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>define a regional economy, its demographics, its workforce and its
assets and gaps in skills and resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Ensure meaningful access to all customers. One-stop centers must
be physically and programmatically accessible to all customers,
including individuals with disabilities. In so doing, one-stop centers
use principles of universal design and human-centered design, such as</li>
</ul>
<p>6</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<p>flexibility in space usage; the use of pictorial, written, verbal, and
tactile modes to present information for customers with disabilities or
limited English proficiency; providing clear lines of sight to
information for seated or standing users; providing necessary
accommodations; and providing adequate space for the use of assistive
devices or personal assistants. One-stop centers use assistive
technology and flexible business hours to meet the range of customer
needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Include both virtual and center-based service delivery for job
seekers, workers, and employers. Both methods of delivery support
the talent needs of the regional economy, although each may better</li>
</ul>
<p>serve different customers with different levels of service needs at any
given time. The one-stop delivery system can expand its reach by
delivering robust virtual services and increasing the accessibility of
those services through community partners, such as libraries,
community and faith-based organizations, and other partners.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Incorporate innovative and evidence-based delivery models that
improve the integration of education and training, create career
pathways that lead to industry-recognized credentials, encourage
work-based learning, and use state-of-the-art technology to accelerate
learning and promote college and career success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c. One-Stop Centers Operate with Integrated Management Systems
and High-Quality Staffing. High-quality one-stop centers:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Reflect the establishment of robust partnerships among partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-one-stop-center-operator-facilitates-an-integrated-co-located">The one-stop center operator facilitates an integrated, co-located</h2>
<p>partnership that seamlessly incorporates services of the core partners
and other one-stop center partners.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Organize and integrate services by function (rather than by
program), when permitted by a program’s authorizing statute and as
appropriate, and by coordinating staff communication, capacity
building, and training efforts. Functional alignment includes having
one-stop center staff who perform similar tasks serve on relevant
functional teams, e.g. Skills Development Team, Business Services</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="team-service-integration-focuses-on-serving-all-customers-seamlessly">Team. Service integration focuses on serving all customers seamlessly</h2>
<p>(including targeted populations) by providing a full range of services
staffed by cross-functional teams, consistent with the purpose, scope,</p>
<p>and requirements of each program.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Develop and maintain integrated case management systems that
inform customer service throughout the customer’s interaction with the
integrated system and allow information collected from customers at</li>
</ul>
<p>7</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<p>intake to be captured once. Customer information is properly secured
in accordance with personally identifiable information guidelines, and
facilitated as appropriate, with the necessary memoranda of
understanding or other forms of confidentiality and data sharing
agreements, consistent with federal and state privacy laws and
regulations. Data, however, would be shared with other programs, for
those programs’ purposes, within the one-stop system only after the
informed written consent of the individual has been obtained, where
required.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Develop and implement operational policies that reflect an
integrated system of performance, communication, and case</li>
</ul>
<p>management, and use technology to achieve integration and expanded
service offerings.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Use common performance indicators to ensure that federal
investments in employment and training programs are evidence-based,
labor market driven, and accountable to participants and taxpayers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="center-performance-is-transparent-and-accountable-to-the-communities">Center performance is transparent and accountable to the communities</h2>
<p>and regions served; data entry staff are trained and understand the
importance of data validation, data collection processes, and the
importance of accurate reporting.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Train and equip one-stop center staff in an ongoing learning process
with the knowledge, skills, and motivation to provide superior service
to job seekers, including those with disabilities, and businesses in an</li>
</ul>
<p>integrated, regionally focused framework of service delivery. Center
staff are cross-trained, as appropriate, to increase staff capacity,
expertise, and efficiency. Cross-training allows staff from differing
programs to understand every program and to share their expertise
about the needs of specific populations so that all staff can better serve
all customers. Center staff are routinely trained and are keenly aware
as to how their particular function supports and contributes to the
overall vision of the local board.</p>
<ul>
<li>• Staff the center with highly trained career counselors, skilled in
advising job seekers of their options, knowledgeable about local labor
market dynamics, aware of available services inside and outside the
one-stop center, and skilled in developing customers’ skills for</li>
