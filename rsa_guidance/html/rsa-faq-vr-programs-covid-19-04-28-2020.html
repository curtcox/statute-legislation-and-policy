<p>The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services’ Rehabilitation Services
Administration (RSA) issues these Questions and Answers in response to inquiries from State</p>
<p>Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies concerning the fiscal management of the VR program
as they seek to provide continuity of operations for individuals with disabilities in the current</p>
<h2 id="covid-19-environment">COVID-19 environment.</h2>
<p>In the near future, RSA plans to issue additional Questions and Answers related to the VR
program, State Supported Employment Services program, and discretionary grant programs,
including the American Indian Vocational Rehabilitation Services program, to respond to other
questions that they have recently asked. State VR agencies and other grantees should contact
their RSA State Liaison or project officer with additional questions. Additional information
specific to the COVID-19 pandemic may be found online at https://www.ed.gov/coronavirus.</p>
<h2 id="personnel-costs">Personnel Costs</h2>
<p>Q1.  May a State VR agency continue to pay the compensation of an employee paid with
grant funds from the U.S. Department of Education (Department) during the period the
employee is unable to work because his or her organization is closed due to novel</p>
<h2 id="coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?</h2>
<p>Yes. Generally, a State VR agency may continue to charge the compensation (including but not
necessarily limited to salaries, wages, and fringe benefits) of its employees who are paid by a
currently active grant funded by the Department to that grant, consistent with the organization’s
policies and procedures for paying compensation from all funding sources, Federal and non-
Federal, under unexpected or extraordinary circumstances, such as a public health emergency
like COVID-19.1 Thus, if the organization pays, consistent with its policies and procedures,
similarly situated employees whose compensation is paid with non-Federal funds during an</p>
<p>extended closure, those paid with grant funds from the Department may also continue to be
paid.2 However, an employee who is being paid with Department grant funds while the program
grant activities are closed in whole or in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic may not also be
paid for the time during which the program is closed by the organization or another organization
for working on other activities that are not closed down.</p>
<p>If a State VR agency does not currently have in place a policy that addresses extraordinary
circumstances such as those caused by COVID-19, the grantee or subgrantee may amend or
create a policy in order to put emergency contingencies in place for Federal and non-Federal</p>

<p>similarly situated employees. If the conditions exist for charges to be made to the Federal grant,
charges may also be made to any non-Federal sources that are used by a grantee in order to meet
a matching requirement.</p>
<p>A State VR agency must maintain appropriate records and cost documentation as required by</p>
<h2 id="2-cfr-200302-financial-management-2-cfr-200430i-standards-for-documenting">2 CFR § 200.302 (financial management), 2 CFR § 200.430(i) (standards for documenting</h2>
<p>personnel expenses), and 2 CFR § 200.333 (retention requirements for records) to substantiate
the charging of any compensation costs related to interruption of operations or services.</p>
<p>At the same time, recipients should consider ways that employees paid with grant funds can
support continuing activities, including remote learning opportunities for students served by the
grant.</p>
<h2 id="allowable-use-of-program-funds">Allowable Use of Program Funds</h2>
<p>Q2.  If a conference, training, or other activity related to a grant from the Department is
cancelled due to COVID-19, may grant funds be used to reimburse nonrefundable
travel (e.g., conveyance or lodging) or registration costs that were properly chargeable
to the grant at the time of booking?</p>
<p>Yes, provided that the State VR agency first seeks to recover nonrefundable costs (e.g., travel,
registration fees) associated with a grant from the Department from the relevant entity that
charged the fee (e.g., airline, hotel, conference organizer). Some businesses are offering
flexibility with regard to refunds, credits, and other remedies for losses due to the COVID-19</p>
<p>outbreak. Moreover, many agreements or contracts for conferences, training, or other activities
related to a grant contain an emergency or “act of God” provision, and the grantee must seek to
exercise those clauses to the extent possible in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>If a State VR agency is unable to recover the costs, the grantee or subgrantee may charge the
appropriate grant for the cancellation costs, provided the costs were reasonable and incurred in
order to carry out an allowable activity under the grant, consistent with the Federal cost
principles described in 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E of the Uniform Administrative Requirements,</p>
<h2 id="cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for-federal-awards-uniform-guidance">Cost Principles, And Audit Requirements For Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).</h2>
<p>State VR agencies should not assume additional funds will be available should the charging of
cancellation or other fees result in a shortage of funds to eventually carry out the event or travel.
Grantees must maintain appropriate records and cost documentation as required by</p>
<h2 id="2-cfr-200302-financial-management-and-2-cfr-200333-retention-requirements-for">2 CFR § 200.302 (financial management) and 2 CFR § 200.333 (retention requirements for</h2>
<p>records) to substantiate the charging of any cancellation or other fees related to the interruption
of operations or services.</p>
<p>Q3.  If a State VR agency is planning future travel under a grant, may it purchase travel
insurance with grant funds?</p>
<p>Due to health concerns related to COVID-19, grant-supported travel generally should not be
occurring. However, if travel is permitted by Federal, State, and local directives and is the only
means to carry out an essential grant function that must be undertaken on a time-sensitive basis
during the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent with the grantee’s travel policy, travel insurance is</p>
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p>allowable provided the cost is reasonable and allocable to the grant consistent with the Federal
cost principles described in 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E of the Uniform Guidance.</p>
<h2 id="period-of-performance">Period of Performance</h2>
<p>Q4.  Can RSA extend the period of performance for the Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2019 VR
program formula award for a State VR agency with funds currently in carryover status
if it is not able to expend these funds, including those reserved for the provision of pre-
employment transition services, by the end of the period of performance due to the
unavailability of staff, the cancellation of VR services, or the inability to purchase VR
services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
<p>No. Existing Federal law does not provide RSA with the authority to extend the period of
performance for the FFY 2019 grant for formula programs (i.e., VR, State Supported
Employment Services, Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind, and
Client Assistance Program) authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation
Act). However, State VR agencies may make new obligations during the period of
performance, which may include a carryover year for awards that meet the carryover
requirements, as explained below.</p>
<p>The period of performance for a VR grant award includes the year of appropriation plus the</p>
<p>carryover year to the extent funds remain available that were matched by September 30 of the
year of appropriation.3 A State VR agency “may charge to the Federal award only allowable
costs incurred during the period of performance” with only a few narrow exceptions generally
not relevant to the VR program.4</p>
<p>For example, for a FFY 2019 VR grant award that qualified for carryover, all expenditures and
obligations charged to the FFY 2019 VR grant award must be those that were incurred between
October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2020 (i.e., the start of the year of appropriation through the
end of the carryover year). For purposes of the FFY 2020 VR grant award, awarded on October
1, 2019, a grantee could incur obligations with those funds through September 30, 2021, if the
agency is able to provide sufficient match by September 30, 2020, to carry those funds over into
the subsequent year.</p>
<p>The Education Department General Administrative Regulations in 34 CFR § 76.707 inform
grantees as to when an obligation is deemed to have occurred based upon the relevant activity.
For example, an obligation for travel is incurred when the travel is taken (34 CFR § 76.707(f)).
On the other hand, an obligation for personal services by a contractor is incurred on the date that
the agency makes a binding written commitment to obtain the services (34 CFR § 76.707(c)). If
an allowable obligation is incurred within the period of performance for the grant award it needs
to be liquidated within the 90-day liquidation period permitted by 2 CFR § 200.343(b). If a
grantee needs additional time to liquidate Federal obligations incurred during the period of</p>
<p>performance for an award after the 90-day liquidation period has ended, a grantee may request</p>

<p>approval from RSA. Please see CFO Memorandum to Chief State School Officers on New
Guidance and information related to the extension of liquidation periods and related accounting
adjustments for grantees under Department of Education State-Administered programs. Requests
for late liquidation should be emailed to the State’s RSA Financial Management Specialist. See
