<p>As required by 34 CFR 80.23(b) for governmental recipients and 34 CFR
74.52(a)(iv)2 for nonprofit recipients, the time limit for liquidation of all
obligations under a formula grant, as well as any subgrants awarded
(where authorized) thereunder, is 90 days after the end of the grant’s
funding period, or the termination of the grant.</p>
<p>Grantees of the programs mentioned above that cannot meet the 90-day
liquidation requirement must request an extension in order to liquidate
their obligations past this time limit. The new Department policy allows</p>
<p>each principal operating component (POC) within the Department to
“consider and approve or disapprove late liquidation requests for up to 12
months after the end of the Tydings period (i.e. 9 months after the end of
normal liquidation period) consistent with the principles outlined below.
For late liquidation requests made after that time, only the Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) has the authority to approve or disapprove the request in</p>
<p>1The Rehabilitation Act provides that if State funding for the general operations of CILs
in the State for a preceding fiscal year equals or exceeds the Federal funds allotted under the Part
C program, the State, if it so chooses, may administer the Part C program as a formula grant
program in accordance with Section 723.</p>

<p>report 90 days after the end of the grant’s funding period. A financial report, however, is not
considered final until all unliquidated obligations are zero. Consequently, in order to comply
with this final report submission requirement, the grantee must liquidate its obligations within 90</p>
<p>days of the close of the grant’s funding period.

during the grant period (including the Tydings period) and only for</li>

requests or related accounting adjustments that move Federal funds
between programs or subgrantees.”
- 3. “The Department generally will not approve late liquidation
requests or related accounting adjustments that move obligations or
expenditures from State or local accounts to Federal programs, but
the Department may approve late liquidation requests that
reimburse the grantee for payments made initially from non-</p>

question.” (Accounting principles used cannot be changed.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-past-performance-of-the-grantee-will-be-considered-in-approving">5. Past performance of the grantee will be considered in approving</h2>
<p>extension requests (e.g. whether the agency is on high-risk or

<p>the grantee must submit an attestation signed by a high-ranking,
authorized official as to the accuracy of the information and
representations that form the basis for the request, including, at a
minimum, an attestation that under the proposed late liquidation and/or
accounting adjustments, Federal funds would only be used for obligations
incurred within the periods of availability of those funds and for allowable
purposes. For requests made more than 12 months after the end of the
Tydings period, that authorized official must be the Chief State School
Officer or the state’s Chief Financial Officer (or comparable officials, in</p>
<p>the case of grantees that are not State educational agencies). In</p>

<h2 id="rsa-procedures">RSA Procedures</h2>
<p>In addition to the Department’s policy requirements, all requests for the
extension of a liquidation period under RSA formula grant programs must
be made in the following manner:</p>
<h2 id="1-requests-must-be-made-in-writing-signed-by-the-grantee-director">1. Requests must be made in writing, signed by the grantee director</h2>

<ul>

<li>• the reason for the request;</li>
<li>• the time period of the extension;</li>
<li>• an assurance that the expenditures were made during the grant
period; and</li>
<li>• an assurance that the funds are allowable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rsa-central-office-will-forward-requests-for-extensions-with-a">RSA Central Office will forward requests for extensions, with a</h2>
<p>recommended course of action, through the Office of Special Education
and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) to the CFO. The CFO will approve
or disapprove the request and notify the POC. RSA will notify the grantee
by letter within 30 days of receipt of the request whether the request for an
extension of time to liquidate the obligations has been approved for
extensions of a year or less.</p>
<p>If the Department grants an extension, the grantee must continue to submit
to the RSA Regional Office all required interim Financial Status Reports
for the affected grant (quarterly for the Title I-- State VR Services</p>
<p>Program; annually for all the other formula grants). However, after all
obligations have been liquidated, the final report will cover the period
from the last interim report through the end date of the extension period.
The final report will be due thirty days after the close of the extension
period.</p>
