<p>1.What is the deadline for entering into a Memorandum of Understanding between the Local</p>
<h2 id="workforce-development-board-and-one-stop-partners">Workforce Development Board and one-stop partners?</h2>
<p>In order to have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in place for Program Year (PY) 2017,
which begins on July 1, 2017, the Local Workforce Development Board (Local WDB) and one-
stop partners must enter into a MOU that aligns with the requirements of WIOA — except for</p>
<p>the final infrastructure funding agreement (IFA) — by June 30, 2017.</p>
<p>2.What is the deadline for finalizing infrastructure funding agreements for Program Year 2017?
The U.S. Department of Labor is using the transition authority of WIOA sec. 503(b) to provide
an extension for the implementation date of the final IFAs for PY 2017. With this extension,
final IFAs must be in place no later than January 1, 2018. However, Governors have the
discretion to require local areas to enter into final IFAs at any time between July 1, 2017, and
January 1, 2018. During the extension period, local areas may use the funding agreement they</p>
<p>used for PY 2016, with any such modifications as the partners may agree to, to fund
infrastructure costs in the local area. During the extension period, the regulations at 20 CFR
678.715(c) and 678.510(b) providing for a six month interim IFA shall not apply. This extension
does not change the deadline of July 1, 2017, for the rest of the MOU.
While one required component of a MOU is the IFA, the Departments realize additional time is
needed for local areas to negotiate and reach consensus on the one-stop partners’
contributions for infrastructure costs for PY 2017. Also, States may need additional time to
develop and implement the State Funding Mechanism (SFM) that is to be applied to those local</p>
<p>areas that are unable to reach a consensus agreement on infrastructure costs in the IFA. In
order to implement the SFM, the Governor must be notified of all the local areas in the State
that are not able to reach consensus in order to calculate the caps on infrastructure spending
applicable to each partner program (20 CFR 678.730(b)(3), 34 CFR 361.730(b)(3), and 34 CFR
463.730(b)(3)). The statewide caps used in the SFM are the aggregate amounts available for
each partner program for all local areas in the State that could not reach consensus with
respect to funding the one-stop system’s infrastructure costs (20 CFR 678.731(b)(5)-(6) and
678.738, 34 CFR 361.731(b)(5)-(6) and 361.738, and 34 CFR 463.731(b)(5)-(6) and 463.738).</p>
<p>They are not separate caps for the program in each local area. Therefore, the expectation is
that the Governor will establish the notification deadline for local areas unable to reach
consensus sufficiently in advance of when the IFA needs to be finalized so the SFM may be
implemented, including calculating and applying the statewide caps, if necessary.</p>
<p>3.What are the required elements of an infrastructure funding agreement?
The jointly-administered regulations at 20 CFR 678.755, 34 CFR 361.755, and 34 CFR 463.755
require IFAs to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. The period of time in which the IFA is effective (which may be a different time period
than the duration of the MOU);</li>
<li>b. Identification of the infrastructure costs budget, which is a component of the overall
one-stop operating budget;</li>

<p>shared operating costs and shared services. While each of these components covers different
cost categories, an operating budget would be incomplete if any of these were omitted because
funding infrastructure costs as well as additional costs is necessary to maintain a fully
functioning and successful local one-stop delivery system. Therefore, the Departments strongly
recommend that the Local WDBs, one-stop partners, and CEOs negotiate the IFA and additional</p>
<p>cost funding together when developing the operating budget for the local one-stop system. The
overall one-stop operating budget must be included in the MOU.
the SFM. This means the SFM will not be triggered due to a failure by the required partners to
reach consensus on additional cost funding or by a failure of any additional partners to join the
consensus regarding the terms of the IFA. When implementing the SFM to determine partner</p>
<p>contributions to cover the one-stop center’s infrastructure costs component, the Governor
should consider the local area’s infrastructure cost needs in light of the additional costs
included in the local one-stop operating budget (e.g., applicable career services costs, shared
operating costs, and the cost of shared services). This should be done while making the
determinations necessary to complete the IFA according to 20 CFR 678.730 - 678.745, 34 CFR
361.730 - 361.745, and 34 CFR 463.730 - 463.745, and should ensure that the infrastructure
costs are sufficient to support the services that the one-stop center will provide. However, it is
important to note that the Governor’s determinations under the SFM pertain only to the</p>
<p>infrastructure costs, and not to any of the additional costs components. The Governor’s
consideration of these other components of the overall local one-stop operating budget is
simply to provide a context for the Governor when determining infrastructure costs under the</p>

<h2 id="5-what-are-infrastructure-costs-what-are-the-distinctions-between-non-personnel-costs-and">5. What are infrastructure costs? What are the distinctions between “non-personnel” costs and</h2>
<p>“personnel” costs?
Infrastructure costs are non-personnel costs that are necessary for the general operation of the
one-stop center, which may include: rental of the facilities; utilities and maintenance;</p>
<p>equipment (including assessment-related and assistive technology for individuals with
disabilities); and technology to facilitate access to the one-stop center, including technology
used for the center’s planning and outreach activities. This may also include the costs
associated with the development and use of the common identifier (i.e., American Job Center
signage) and supplies, as defined in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.94, to support the</p>
<p>general operation of the one-stop center (WIOA sec. 121(h)(4) and 20 CFR 678.700(a), 34 CFR
361.700(a), and 34 CFR 463.700(a)).
Non-personnel costs are all costs that are not compensation for personnel costs. For example,
technology-related services performed by vendors or contractors are non-personnel costs and
may be identified as infrastructure costs if they are necessary for the general operation of the
one-stop center. Such costs would include service contracts with vendors or contractors,</p>
<p>equipment, and supplies.
Personnel services include salaries, wages, and fringe benefits of the employees of partner
programs or their subrecipients, as described in 2 CFR 200.430 - 200.431 of the Uniform
Guidance. For example, allocable salary and fringe costs of partner program staff who work on
information technology systems (e.g., common performance and reporting outcomes) for use
by the one-stop center as a whole would be personnel costs. The cost of a shared welcome
desk or greeter directing employers and customers to the services or staff that are available in
that one-stop center is a personnel expense. These costs, therefore, could not be included in</p>
<p>infrastructure costs but are included in “additional costs.”</p>
<h2 id="6-which-wioa-one-stop-partner-programs-are-required-to-contribute-towards-one-stop">6. Which WIOA one-stop partner programs are required to contribute towards one-stop</h2>
<p>infrastructure costs?
All required partners that carry out their program in the local area must contribute toward</p>
<p>infrastructure costs based on their proportionate use of the one-stop delivery centers and
relative benefits received. (WIOA sec. 121(b) and 121(h); 20 CFR 678.400, 678.410, 678.415,
and 678.700(c); 34 CFR 361.400, 361.410, 361.415, and 361.700(c); and 34 CFR 463.400,
463.410, 463.415, and 463.700(c)). Additional partners, which are any local one-stop partner
programs that are not listed as required partner programs, also must contribute to
infrastructure costs in the local areas in which they are partners. However, the SFM is only
applicable to required one-stop partners. This means that additional partners cannot trigger the
SFM by not joining in the overall consensus regarding the terms of the IFA, nor are they subject</p>
<p>to the SFM if it is triggered. Although WIOA does not subject the additional partners to the
Governor’s determination of required partners’ infrastructure cost contributions under the
SFM, the additional partners must contribute toward infrastructure costs in accordance with
the program’s proportionate use and relative benefit received, consistent with the Uniform</p>

<p>Native American programs (described in WIOA sec. 166), as required one-stop partners, are
strongly encouraged to contribute to infrastructure costs, but they are not required to make
such contributions under WIOA. Any agreement regarding the contribution or non-contribution
to infrastructure costs by Native American programs must be documented in the MOU. Further,

The requirements that govern infrastructure costs apply to each one-stop center in the local</p>
<p>delivery system, whether the center is a comprehensive, affiliate, or specialized one-stop
center. All one-stop partners, whether they are required partners or additional partners —
except as discussed above concerning Native American programs — must contribute to the
infrastructure cost funding of the one-stop centers based on proportionate use and relative
benefits received. The required one-stop partners must provide access to their programs in the</p>
<p>comprehensive one-stop centers and contribute to the infrastructure costs of those centers.
Only those one-stop partners that participate in the affiliate one-stop centers are required to
contribute to the infrastructure costs for those centers. As with MOUs, the Local WDB may
negotiate an umbrella IFA or individual IFAs for one or more of its one-stop centers.</p>

To put the question more precisely: If a required one-stop partner program administered by an
entity outside the control or authority of the Governor does not want to contribute towards
infrastructure costs, or disagrees on the appropriate amount to contribute, and the State</p>
<p>Funding Mechanism is triggered, can the Governor require this program to make a specific
financial contribution? Can the program file an appeal?</p>
<p>Under the SFM, the Governor has authority to determine the financial contribution of all
required one-stop partners toward infrastructure costs in accordance with 20 CFR 678.725 –
678.738, 34 CFR 361.725 – 361.738, and 34 CFR 463.725 – 463.738. For the Adult Education and
Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program, the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program, and

<p>cost contributions — or those determinations made, in certain cases, by the applicable official
or chief officer — in accordance with the process established under 20 CFR 678.750, 34 CFR
361.750, and 34 CFR 463.750.</p>
<h2 id="9-what-are-non-cash-contributions-and-how-are-they-valued">9. What are non-cash contributions and how are they valued?</h2>
<p>Non-cash contributions are expenditures incurred by one-stop partners on behalf of the one-
stop center and goods or services contributed by a partner program and used by the one-stop
center. The value of non-cash contributions must be consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 and
reconciled on a regular basis (i.e., monthly or quarterly) to ensure they are fairly evaluated and
meet the partners’ proportionate share. One way to ensure that non-cash contributions are</p>
<p>fairly evaluated is to ensure that the one-stop partners agree on the sources or companies that
will be used to assess or appraise the fair market value or fair rental value of non-cash
contributions (2 CFR 200.306).
Example 1: For Program Year (PY) 2017, a partner’s proportionate use of the one-stop center
results in a contribution of $15,000. The partner does not have sufficient cash resources to fully</p>
<p>fund its share and wishes to donate to the one-stop center (not for its own individual use)
gently used surplus office furniture. The furniture is needed in the one-stop center. The office
furniture was purchased in 2015 for $18,500 using unrestricted or non-Federal funds. The office
furniture has a current fair market value of $10,000 and a depreciated value of $11,100. In
accordance with the requirements specified in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.306(d), the
value of the contribution must be the lesser of the current fair market value or the value of the
remaining life of the property as recorded in the partner’s accounting records at the time of
donation unless approval has been granted, by the Federal awarding agency, in accordance</p>
<p>with 2 CFR 200.306(d)(2). The partner would be able to count the $10,000 value as part of its
$15,000 contribution and would be required to use additional resources for the remaining
$5,000 balance of its share. This one-time contribution is recognized by the partner during the
year in which the contribution is made.
Example 2: In the same example as above, the partner does not donate the gently used office
furniture but loans it for general use by partners at the one-stop center. The office furniture is
on a five-year depreciation schedule. The annual depreciation is $3,700 and the annual fair
rental value is $3,500. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(i)(4), the partner may count $3,500 as</p>
<p>part of its contribution for that year. As with any depreciable asset, an assessment of its fair
rental value must be done each year in which the equipment is loaned to the one-stop center.
The one-stop partners must determine annually whether the one-stop center still requires the
use of the office furniture and that this cost is built into the IFA.</p>
<h2 id="10-what-are-third-party-in-kind-contributions-and-how-are-they-valued">10. What are third-party in-kind contributions and how are they valued?</h2>
<p>Third-party in-kind contributions are contributions of space, equipment, technology, non-
personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-</p>
<p>stop operations. The value of third-party in-kind contributions must also be consistent with the
Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.306 and reconciled on a regular basis (i.e., monthly or
quarterly) to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the partners’ proportionate share.</p>

<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>There are two types of third-party in-kind contributions: (1) general contributions to one-stop
operations (i.e., those not connected to any individual one-stop partner), and (2) those made
specifically to a one-stop partner program (20 CFR 678.715, 34 CFR 361.715, and 34 CFR
463.715, and 2 CFR 200.306).
Example 1: For PY 2017, a county government that is not a one-stop partner, has space in a
vacant building and would like to donate the space for use as a one-stop center. This in-kind
contribution would not be associated with one specific partner, but rather would go to support</p>
<p>the one-stop center generally and would be factored into the underlying budget and cost pools
used to determine proportionate share. The value of the donated space by a third party must
adhere to the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.306(i)(3). The annual fair rental value of
comparable space in the same locality, as established by an independent appraisal, is $77,000.
As with all non-cash and third-party in-kind contributions, the value at which the space has
been appraised is the amount accounted for in the infrastructure budget. The value of the
donated space should be assessed again each subsequent year.</p>
<p>The second type of third-party in-kind contribution is a contribution to a specific partner to
support that partner’s proportionate share of one-stop infrastructure costs. If the contribution
was in the one-stop center’s budget for infrastructure costs, the partner could then use the
value of the third-party in-kind contribution to count toward its proportionate share.
Example 2: An employer provides assistive technology equipment to a VR program located in a
one-stop center. The acquisition cost for the equipment at the time of purchase by the
employer was $6,800 and, at the time of the donation, the fair market value was assessed as
$4,500. If the assistive technology equipment was in the one-stop center’s budget for</p>
<p>infrastructure costs, the partner could use the fair market value of the donation toward its
contribution. The Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.306(g) requires that the equipment is valued
at no more than the fair market value ($4,500) at the time of donation.
Example 3: A local literacy foundation wants to donate gently used computer equipment to the
local one-stop center to support the infrastructure cost contribution of the designated AEFLA
partner program in the local community. Computer equipment is part of the one-stop operating
budget. The fair market value of the computer equipment is valued at $9,200 at the time of
donation. The AEFLA partner program’s proportionate use of the one-stop center is determined</p>
<p>to be $12,500. The AEFLA partner program may use the fair market value of this equipment
towards its infrastructure cost contribution for that program year. Furthermore, the AEFLA
partner program is required to contribute an additional $3,300 in cash, non-cash, or in-kind
contributions from its available resources to pay its remaining share.</p>
<h2 id="11-will-the-specific-wioa-requirements-for-local-agreements-for-funding-the-onestop-infrastructure">11. Will the specific WIOA requirements for local agreements for funding the one–stop infrastructure</h2>
<p>costs apply in PY 2016?
No. The specific requirements for the local funding agreements, which are related to how the
shared and infrastructure costs of the one–stop service delivery system will be paid by the one–
stop partners, need not be satisfied in the funding agreements for PY 2016. States and local</p>
<p>areas may continue to negotiate local funding agreements as they have been doing so
under Workforce Investment Act (WIA) for purposes of PY 2016. However, the local funding
agreements must satisfy the requirements of section 121(h) of WIOA for purposes of funding
the one–stop system in PY 2017.</p>

In the event of failure to reach an agreement for funding the one–stop system in PY 2016, the

The Governor and the State Board should begin developing the guidance to be used by the local
