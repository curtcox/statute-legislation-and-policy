<h2 id="the-helen-keller-national-center-hknc-is-a-national">The Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) is a national</h2>
<p>rehabilitation program authorized by the Helen Keller National
Center Act, as amended (HKNC Act), to provide services for youth
and adults who are deaf-blind. Recent amendments to the HKNC
Act authorize the HKNC to establish and maintain a registry of
individuals who are deaf-blind in order to assist the Center in</p>
<p>providing services to this population.</p>

<h2 id="although-the-definition-of-an-individual-who-is-deaf-blind">Although the definition of an "individual who is deaf-blind,"</h2>
<p>contained in the HKNC Act (see attached), has been commonly
accepted by State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, this
population is reported inconsistently on the RSA-911. For example,
in FY 1998, only 456 individuals nationally were reported as being
"deaf-blind," using codes 290-298; an additional 27 were listed with
“deaf-blindness” as a secondary disability, 153 indicated
“blindness” as major and “deafness” as secondary and 19 reported
“deafness” as major and “blindness” as secondary.</p>

anyone outside of the HKNC without the individual's specific written
consent.</p>

<p>asking for your assistance in identifying individuals who may want</p>

circulate these items to key people within your organization who
can distribute them to individuals who are deaf-blind and/or their
parents or guardians. Although registration is voluntary, if an
individual chooses to register he or she must provide, at a
minimum, his/her name, address, date of birth and some indication
of deafness and blindness. Return completed registration forms to
the HKNC.</p>

<p>The Helen Keller National Center is a national rehabilitation facility funded
by the federal government to provide services for youths and adults who are
deaf-blind. Recently, our mandate was broadened to allow us to develop and
maintain a registry of persons who are deaf-blind.</p>
<p>Information obtained by the registry will be used to generate statistical</p>
<p>information that will be used in the following ways:</p>
<h2 id="1-it-will-be-shared-with-adult-service-programs-so-they-will-be-better">1. It will be shared with adult service programs so they will be better</h2>
<p>prepared for serving youths and adults who are deaf-blind.</p>
<h2 id="2-it-will-be-shared-with-teacher-and-interpreter-preparation-programs-to">2. It will be shared with teacher and interpreter preparation programs to</h2>
<p>prepare professionals to work with this population.</p>
<h2 id="3-it-will-be-used-for-program-planning-for-transition-age-youth-14-21">3. It will be used for program planning for transition age youth (14-21</h2>
<p>years of age) as they transition out of the educational system.</p>
<h2 id="4-it-will-be-shared-with-state-and-federal-governments-as-they-develop">4. It will be shared with state and federal governments as they develop</h2>

<p>service providers who work with individuals who are deaf-blind of any age to
fill out the enclosed registry form and return it to us. Be assured that all</p>
<p>personal information will be kept in the strictest confidence.</p>
