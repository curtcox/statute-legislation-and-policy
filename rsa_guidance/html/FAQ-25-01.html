<p>The Departments have determined that it is appropriate and reasonable to assess performance for
the WIOA title II program for PY 2024 for the following performance indicators as applicable:
- • Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit; and
- • Measurable Skill Gains.</p>
<p>The Departments have determined that the available baseline data are not sufficient to produce
reliable estimates using the required statistical adjustment model for the remaining performance
indicators. Therefore, the Departments have determined it is necessary to use their transition
authority, pursuant to section 503(a) of WIOA, to delay assessment of:
- • Effectiveness in Serving Employers for all WIOA core programs4;
- • Median Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit, Employment Rate 4th Quarter after Exit, and</p>
<h2 id="credential-attainment-rate-for-the-wioa-title-ii-core-program">Credential Attainment Rate for the WIOA title II core program;</h2>

<li>• The Overall State Indicator Scores for Median Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit,
Employment Rate 4th Quarter after Exit, and Credential Attainment Rate; and</li>
<li>• The Overall State Program Scores for the WIOA title II program.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the Departments will not assess performance for the purpose of imposing sanctions
for the above performance indicators for PY 2024 but will continue to use performance data for
effective program management, oversight, monitoring, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>States are required to submit timely and complete performance reports for PY 2024 and will be
sanctioned for failure to do so.5 If a state is unable to submit complete and timely performance
reports by October 1, 2025, due to exceptional circumstances outside of the state’s control, it
must notify the Departments pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 677.185(c) and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.185(c)
and 463.185(c) and consistent with guidance set forth in TAC-20-02. The practical implications
of the Departments’ decision on sanctions implementation are explained in a series of questions
and answers below.</p>
<p>With respect to the title II core program, states report aggregate data annually, resulting in four
times less data than is generated each year for the titles I, III, and IV core programs for use in the
statistical adjustment model. As a result, it is taking more time for the title II model to yield
reliable estimates for purposes of measuring program performance on some indicators; however,
with each additional year’s worth of data, the Departments have observed improvement in the
model’s ability to produce reliable estimates, as evidenced by the inclusion of additional</p>

<p>indicators in the PY 2024 assessment. This continued and steady improvement constitutes
progress toward the Departments’ ability to assess all performance indicators for all core
programs. In the meantime, the Departments have determined it is necessary to use the transition
authority in section 503(a) of WIOA to provide for the orderly transition to the WIOA
performance accountability requirements for all core programs.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h2 id="section-116-of-wioa-establishes-primary-performance-indicators-that-apply-to-the-six-core">Section 116 of WIOA establishes primary performance indicators that apply to the six core</h2>
<p>programs and reporting requirements that assess states’ effectiveness in achieving positive
outcomes for individuals and employers served by WIOA’s six core programs.6 WIOA also
requires that the Departments use a statistical adjustment model to assess state performance by
adjusting negotiated performance levels for the characteristics of participants actually served</p>
<p>throughout the program year and for the actual economic conditions within the state. WIOA
requires the Departments to use the model to assess state performance and determine whether a
state has met its adjusted levels of performance. The Departments developed a model and
process for this purpose.7 To date, the implementation of a model and the performance
accountability provisions have informed the Departments’ performance negotiations with states,
helped to prioritize technical assistance efforts, and advanced the workforce system toward a
more objective and data-driven accountability structure.</p>
<p>WIOA instituted a new approach to performance accountability in the workforce system, and the
Departments find it is taking longer to collect sufficient baseline data to produce reliable
estimates from the statistical adjustment model for certain performance indicators and for certain
core programs than had been anticipated. The Departments remain focused and committed to
collecting performance data and promoting robust practices related to data collection, data
integrity, and complete reporting. As additional data are collected, the Departments will continue
to review and refine the statistical adjustment model.</p>
<h2 id="section-503a-of-wioa-authorizes-the-secretaries-of-education-and-labor-to-take-such-action-as">Section 503(a) of WIOA authorizes the Secretaries of Education and Labor to take such action as</h2>
<p>appropriate to provide for the orderly transition from any requirement under WIA to those under
WIOA, including those related to the performance accountability system established in section
116 of WIOA. The Departments have determined that it would be inappropriate to assess for</p>
<p>performance pursuant to section 116(b)(3)(A) of WIOA and 20 C.F.R. § 677.190, and 34 C.F.R.
§§ 361.190 and 463.190, and to impose sanctions pursuant to section 116(f) of WIOA, on a state
on the basis of a statistical adjustment model for which the available baseline data are not
sufficient to produce reliable estimates.</p>
<p>Use of WIOA’s transition authority to delay assessing performance and imposing sanctions is an
appropriate action for an orderly transition to the WIOA performance accountability system,</p>

<p>because of the performance accountability system’s reliance on the statistical adjustment model.
Therefore, the Departments determined that it is necessary to use the transition authority in
section 503(a) of WIOA to delay assessing performance and imposing sanctions against states
that fail to meet adjusted levels of performance for those Individual Indicator Scores, as well as
for the Overall State Program Scores and the Overall State Indicator Scores, for which the
baseline data are not sufficient.</p>
<p>However, the Departments have determined there are sufficient baseline data for the statistical
adjustment model to yield consistently reliable results for all of the performance indicators for
the WIOA titles I, III, and IV core programs, as applicable, as well as for Employment Rate in
the 2nd Quarter After Exit and Measurable Skill Gains for WIOA title II. Therefore, the
Departments have determined it is appropriate for DOL and ED to assess performance for those
performance indicators for PY 2024 in accordance with joint WIOA regulations and the phased-
in approach to performance assessments described in TAC-20-02. Notably, this will be the first
program year since the enactment of WIOA that the Departments will be assessing Overall State</p>
<p>Program Scores for the titles I and IV core programs, and Overall State Indicator Scores for
Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit and Measurable Skill Gains. The Departments, as
permitted under section 503(a) of WIOA, will delay assessing performance for the purpose of
imposing sanctions for the remaining performance indicators. The following questions and
answers explain what this means in practical terms.</p>

<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>The Departments will also assess state performance for the Overall State Program Score for the
WIOA title I, title III, and title IV core programs since the Departments will be assessing all of
the Individual Indicator Scores applicable to that program. The Departments will also assess state
performance for the Overall State Indicator Score for Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit
and Measurable Skill Gains since the Departments will be assessing these Individual Indicator
Scores for all of the applicable programs. See Attachments I and II for additional information.</p>
<p>Q2: What happens if a state has a performance failure with respect to WIOA titles I, II, III,
and IV core program Individual Indicator Scores or the WIOA titles I, III, and IV core
program Overall State Program Score for PY 2024?</p>
<p>If a WIOA title I, II, III, or IV core program, for the first time, fails to achieve an Individual
Indicator Score of at least 50 percent, as described on page 14-15 of TAC-20-02, for the</p>
<p>individual indicators that will be assessed in PY 2024 (as described in Question 1 above), the
state must receive technical assistance and develop a performance improvement plan in
accordance with section 116(f)(1)(A) of WIOA. If the state fails the same Individual Indicator
Score for the same program, for the second consecutive time in PY 2024 or PY 2025, the
Departments must impose a financial sanction in accordance with section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA.</p>
<p>If a WIOA title I, III, or IV core program, for the first time, fails to achieve an Overall State
Program Score of at least 90 percent in PY 2024, as described on page 14-15 of TAC-20-02, the
state must receive technical assistance and develop a performance improvement plan in
accordance with section 116(f)(1)(A) of WIOA. If a state WIOA title I, III, or IV core program
fails to achieve an Overall State Program Score of 90 percent, for the second consecutive time in
PY 2024 or PY 2025, the Departments must impose a financial sanction in accordance with
section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA.</p>
<p>Q3: Will the Departments suspend or delay WIOA performance reporting for PY 2024?</p>
<p>No, states must submit complete and timely performance information as they have done since</p>
<h1 id="py-2016">PY 2016.</h1>
<p>Q4: Will states be subject to sanctions for failure to submit complete and timely reports for</p>
<h1 id="py-2024">PY 2024?</h1>
<p>Yes, states are subject to sanctions for failure to submit complete and timely performance reports
for all six core programs, as has been true since PY 2017. Failing to certify complete PY 2024
annual performance reports by October 1, 2025, could lead to a financial sanction through a
reduction of a state’s PY 2025 Governor’s Reserve funds.9 For details regarding complete and
timely reporting and requesting an annual reporting extension, refer to pages 11-13 of TAC-20-
02.</p>
<h2 id="9-this-refers-to-the-percentage-of-a-states-wioa-title-i-allotment-that-the-states-governor-is-allowed-to-reserve-for">9 This refers to the percentage of a state’s WIOA title I allotment that the state’s Governor is allowed to reserve for</h2>

<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>Q5: If the Departments are not using the data for certain indicators to assess performance
for sanctions purposes, how will the Departments use performance data from PY 2024?</p>
<p>The Departments will continue to use the data for the purposes of effective program
management, system oversight, monitoring and internal controls, and the provision of technical
assistance, including implementing methods for ensuring data reliability, as appropriate. The
Departments will share performance results with states as appropriate. States should expect to
review performance data for PY 2024 and prepare to engage with Federal staff to discuss, among
other topics, data quality, continuous improvement, and performance results. All data reported by
states, even those not used for performance assessment in a particular PY, benefit the statistical
adjustment model used by the Departments by increasing the amount of data input, thereby
enabling the model to produce more reliable results over time.</p>
<p>Q6: Does the Departments’ decision regarding assessing for performance for PY 2024
apply to PY 2025 too?</p>
<p>The Departments’ decision to assess state performance for certain performance indicators and
overall scores based on the reliability of the statistical adjustment model applies to PY 2024
only. The Departments’ decision for PY 2024 is based on a determination that sufficient baseline
data are available to produce reliable estimates using the statistical adjustment model for the
indicators that will be assessed for performance. In an effort to accelerate the full implementation
of WIOA performance accountability requirements, the Departments will make a separate
assessment of the model’s reliability for PY 2025, rather than making a determination to delay
certain assessments for both program years at this time. The Departments are therefore
advancing performance assessment consistent with the reliability of the data yielded by the
statistical adjustment model. For those indicators for which assessment is delayed in PY 2024,
the Departments will make a new determination for PY 2025 with the benefit of another year’s
worth of data input for the model.</p>
