<p>Implementation of Retention with the Same Employer as the Definition of Effectiveness in Serving</p>
<h2 id="employers-under-the-workforce-innovation-and-opportunity-act-wioa">Employers under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)</h2>
<h2 id="performance-accountability-system">Performance Accountability System</h2>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>On February 23, 2024, the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor (the Departments) published
a final rule in the Federal Register (89 FR 13814) that defines the sixth performance indicator—
effectiveness in serving employers—as Retention with the Same Employer in the second and
fourth quarters following a participant’s exit from a WIOA core program—and requires it be
reported by one WIOA core program on behalf of all six such programs within each State. The
final rule will take effect on March 25, 2024.</p>
<p>The purpose of these jointly-issued FAQs is to outline when States must begin collecting and
reporting Retention with the Same Employer data and inform States of the information collection
requests (ICRs) and joint policy guidance the Departments will revise in accordance with this new
regulatory definition.</p>
<p>Q1: When must States collect and report performance data for Retention with the Same Employer?</p>
<p>Because the new definition for effectiveness in serving employers takes effect on March 25, 2024,</p>
<p>WIOA core programs must begin collecting data for Retention with the Same Employer in
Program Year (PY) 2024, which begins on July 1, 2024 (i.e., the first full PY following the
regulation’s effective date). Given the data to be collected and the lag time in programs’ ability to
obtain the requisite employment data for reporting purposes, these PY 2024 data will account for
participants who exited core programs during calendar year 2023 (January 1, 2023 to December
31, 2023).</p>
<p>Each State must report an annual aggregated and unduplicated performance result, across the six
WIOA core programs, on the PY 2024 WIOA Statewide Performance Report Template (ETA-
9169); these reports are due no later than October 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Departments will consider PY 2024 performance results on Retention with the Same
Employer as baseline data for purposes of the statistical adjustment model.</p>

<p>Q2: Will the Departments update the WIOA ICRs to include Retention with the Same Employer?</p>
<p>Yes, the publication of the final rule defining effectiveness in serving employers serves as the
notice of the start of the 30-day comment period to incorporate these changes into the following</p>

Q3: Will the Departments update WIOA joint policy guidance to include Retention with the Same</p>
<h2 id="employer">Employer?</h2>
<p>Yes, during Fiscal Year 2024, the Departments will revise two joint policy guidance documents to
include Retention with the Same Employer. First, the Departments will revise Performance
Accountability Guidance for WIOA Core Programs (Employment and Training Administration
- (ETA) Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) 10-16, Office of Career, Technical,
and Adult Education (OCTAE) Program Memorandum (PM) 17-2, and Rehabilitation Services
Administration (RSA) Technical Assistance Circular (TAC) 17-01) to include Retention with the
Same Employer and technical assistance related to data collection and reporting of that data.
Second, the Departments will revise Negotiations and Sanctions Guidance for WIOA Core
Programs (ETA TEGL 11-19, OCTAE PM 20-2, and RSA TAC 20-02) to explain how the
Departments will incorporate Retention with the Same Employer in the negotiation and
performance assessment processes.</p>
