<p>The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), within the U.S. Department of Education’s
- (Department) Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, issues this Frequently</p>
<p>Asked Questions (FAQs) document in response to inquiries concerning the administration of the
Randolph-Sheppard Financial Relief and Restoration Payments (FRRP) Appropriation.</p>
<p>In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Division H, Title III, Section 318 (Section 318),
Congress directed the Department to make $20 million available for the purposes of making
grants to State licensing agencies (SLA) designated to administer the Randolph-Sheppard Act
(Act). Section 318 directed the Department to make grants to SLAs in the same proportion as the
number of blind vendors operating a vending facility in a State as compared to the number of
blind vendors operating a vending facility in all the States on September 30, 2019. The SLAs
must use these grants:</p>
<ul>
<li>•  to make financial relief and restoration payments to offset losses of blind vendors that
occurred during calendar year 2020 and which were not otherwise compensated; and</li>
<li>•  for other purposes authorized under 34 C.F.R. § 395.9 (regarding the setting aside of funds
by the SLA), but only to the extent any funds remain after the SLA makes financial relief
and restoration payments to blind vendors to cover their losses incurred in calendar year
2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>The funds shall remain available for obligation by the Secretary until September 30, 2021.</p>
<p>Other than statutory and regulatory requirements included in this document, the contents of this
guidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This
document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under
the law or agency policies. The Department has determined that this document is significant
guidance under the Office of Management and Budget’s Final Bulletin for Agency Good</p>
<h2 id="guidance-practices-72-fed-reg-3432-jan-25-2007">Guidance Practices, 72 Fed. Reg. 3432 (Jan. 25, 2007).</h2>
<p>Q1. Is a vendor, who incurred losses during calendar year 2020, eligible for FRRP funds if
the vendor is no longer a vendor in a facility with the State Business Enterprise Program
- (BEP) under the Act?</p>
<p>No. Congress authorized the Department to make $20 million available to make grants to SLAs
to provide relief and restoration payments to blind vendors. If a blind vendor has left the State’s</p>
<p>1</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p>BEP (e.g., the person retired, resigned, or was terminated by the program), they are not eligible
for FRRP funds because they are no longer a vendor (i.e., operating a vending facility) as defined
by the Department’s implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. § 395.1(aa), which provides,</p>
<p>“(aa) Vendor means a blind licensee who is operating a vending facility on Federal or other
property.”</p>
<p>However, if a vendor is not operating a vending facility because the site closed in calendar year
2020 and remains closed, but the operation of a facility is on hold (e.g., the vending facility is
temporarily closed for an undetermined period of time because it is located within a building that
is closed or currently has no occupants but is expected to reopen in the future), the vendor is
eligible for FRRP funds.</p>
<p>Q2. If a vendor had a facility in 2020, but did not have a facility in 2019, is that vendor still
able to show a loss in 2020 and be eligible for FRRP funds?</p>
<p>Yes. A vendor is eligible to receive FRRP funds for losses incurred during calendar year 2020 to
the extent such losses are not otherwise compensated. Section 318 does not require that the
individual be a vendor in 2019, even though the percentage of funds an SLA receives is
determined by the proportion of blind vendors in the States as of September 30, 2019. A
vendor’s 2020 losses could be calculated in many ways. For example, a vendor could show</p>
<p>losses based on the amount of income earned in 2020 as compared to the amount of expenses
paid; the SLAs could rely on historical data on facilities to estimate expected earnings of a
particular facility; or a vendor could extrapolate from the months in 2020 that it was open.
Furthermore, a vendor may claim losses for spoiled or expired stock, which could be an
additional calculation of loss for calendar year 2020. This is not an exhaustive list of how to
calculate losses; the SLA and Elected Committee should take a flexible and reasonable view on
how to determine vendor losses, taking into account the varying circumstances that may be
occurring in its State.</p>
<p>Q3. May FRRP funds be used to cover any losses of products incurred by the vendor?</p>
<p>Yes. SLAs may use the FRRP funds to make financial relief and restoration payments to offset
losses of blind vendors that occurred during calendar year 2020 and which were not otherwise
compensated. Losses are not limited only to income. For example, if vendors had to dispose of
unused stock they had purchased because it spoiled or expired during calendar year 2020, that is
a loss that can be offset by FRRP payments.</p>
<p>Q4. Is a blind vendor eligible for FRRP funds if the vendor’s losses, incurred in calendar
year 2020, were unrelated to the pandemic?</p>
<p>Yes. There is no requirement in Section 318 that a vendor’s losses incurred in calendar year 2020
be tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, SLAs may provide FRRP funds to compensate
vendors for losses incurred during calendar year 2020 when those losses are not related to the
pandemic, such as losses due to hurricanes, other natural disasters, or other reasons beyond the
control of the vendor.</p>

<p>Q5. Should certain types of benefits, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI),
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, unemployment benefits, etc. be taken into
account when determining if an individual was “otherwise compensated?”</p>
<p>RSA interprets the term “otherwise compensated” to refer to funds that a blind vendor received
from another source to compensate for the loss. If a vendor was already receiving a certain
benefit before the loss was incurred, then it should not be considered compensation because of
the loss. If a vendor received a benefit after a loss was incurred, whether that benefit should be
considered compensation should be a case-by-case determination depending on the benefit, the
connection between the benefit and the loss, and any other relevant circumstances to the case.
We note that administration of the PPP loans, unemployment benefits, and SSDI fall within the
purview of other Federal and State agencies, not RSA. Fair minimum return payments and
vacation or sick leave payments paid from the set aside funds under 34 C.F.R § 395.9 could be</p>
<p>considered compensation because of the close connection between the benefit received and the
loss sustained. However, as with all decisions regarding how each State’s funds will be used, the
SLA is required to actively participate1 with the Elected Committee of Blind Vendors when
making these decisions.</p>
<p>Q6. Can FRRP funds be used to offset losses incurred during calendar year 2021?</p>
<p>No. Section 318 makes clear that the SLAs are only authorized to use FRRP funds to make
financial relief and restoration payments to offset losses of blind vendors that occurred during
calendar year 2020. Because the statute designates the timeframe covered by the relief payments,
RSA has no authority to allow FRRP funds to be used to compensate losses incurred outside of
calendar year 2020.</p>
<p>Q7. Can SLAs use FRRP funds to pay the costs of administering the grant?</p>
<p>Yes. SLAs may use FRRP funds to pay necessary and reasonable administrative costs incurred
during the administration of the FRRP grant (e.g., to pay for staff time to actively participate
with the Elected Committee of Blind Vendors regarding the distribution of the funds, the time
spent distributing the funds, and time spent satisfying fiscal and performance reporting
requirements). Each SLA will have to do its own analysis, using the Federal cost principles, to
determine what amount of administrative costs would be allowable with FRRP funds pursuant to</p>

<p>of Blind Vendors in “major administrative decisions and policy and program development decisions affecting the
overall administration of the State’s vending facility program.” The disbursement of FRRP funds is a major
administrative decision; therefore, the Elected Committee needs to be involved in the discussions on how to disburse
FRRP funds. See RSA-TAC 21-01 https://rsa.ed.gov/sites/default/files/subregulatory/RSA%20TAC%2021-

<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<p>When charging administrative costs to the FRRP grant, an SLA may only charge those
administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for the performance of the FRRP grant, as
opposed to administering the Randolph-Sheppard Act program in general. Only in so doing will
the SLA be able to ensure that FRRP administrative costs are: 1) necessary and reasonable for
the performance of the FRRP grant in accordance with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403 and 200.404; (2)
allocable to the FRRP grant in accordance with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403 and 200.405; and (3) kept as
low as possible, thereby ensuring maximum FRRP funds are available for the stated purposes
described in Section 318.</p>
<p>An SLA is not required to use FRRP funds to pay its associated administrative costs. It may use
other State or private funds available for this purpose.</p>
<p>Q8. May an SLA use Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program funds to pay administrative
costs incurred in administering the FRRP grants?</p>
<p>Yes, but only to the extent an SLA is using FRRP grant funds for purposes allowable under 34
C.F.R. § 395.9 that are also authorized as a VR service to groups under Section 103(b)(1) of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) and 34 C.F.R. § 361.49(a)(5). Under the Federal
cost principles set forth at 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403 through 200.405, if there are FRRP grant
expenditures that are allocable to the VR program, the associated administrative costs incurred for
those particular services also would be allocable to the VR program. In such a case, the SLA may
use VR program funds to cover a proportional share of those administrative costs since the VR
program would be benefitting from those expenditures as well. In allocating the administrative</p>
<p>costs between the FRRP and VR grants, the SLA would need to determine which amount was
reasonable and necessary for the performance of the VR award and the FRRP award to determine
the allowable and allocable amount to be charged to each award in accordance with the
requirements of 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403 through 200.405. The SLA should maintain the appropriate
records to justify that the expense was reasonable and necessary to administer the grant.</p>
<p>However, to the extent an SLA uses the FRRP grant funds to make financial relief and restoration
payments to blind vendors who incurred losses in calendar year 2020, which is the primary
purpose of the FRRP grants, such payments are beyond the scope of allowable costs under the VR
program pursuant to Section 103(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.49(a)(5), as
it relates to the Randolph-Sheppard Act program. Therefore, any associated administrative costs
also would not be allowable under, or allocable to, the VR program pursuant to 2 C.F.R.
§§ 200.403 through 200.405.</p>
<p>Q9. Will the SLAs use the RSA-15 (Report of Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility</p>
<h2 id="program-form-to-report-distribution-and-use-of-frrp-funds">Program) form to report distribution and use of FRRP funds?</h2>
<p>No. SLAs will be required to submit a SF-425 form to report fiscal information at the end of</p>
<p>Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2021 and at the end of FFY 2022, if the SLA is still distributing and
using FRRP grant funds in FFY 2022. In addition, SLAs will be required to submit a
performance report at the end of the period of performance (i.e., September 30, 2022) for the</p>
