<h2 id="dear-colleagues">Dear Colleagues:</h2>
<p>Through this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL-25-02), the Rehabilitation Services Administration
- (RSA) is transmitting a copy of the revised Vocational Rehabilitation Financial Report (RSA-17)</p>
<p>form and instructions for the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VR) program. Due to the
minimal nature of the changes, the revisions to the RSA-17 are effective immediately. The RSA-
17 collects semiannual cumulative VR financial data on an award-by-award basis.</p>
<h2 id="for-your-convenience-the-edits-to-the-form-and-instructions-include">For your convenience, the edits to the form and instructions include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  Making the instructions consistent with OMBs April 22, 2024, revisions to 2 C.F.R. part</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="200-89-fr-07496">200 (89 FR 07496);</h1>
<ul>
<li>•  Making the instructions consistent with ED’s General Administrative Regulations</li>
<li>(EDGAR) final rule published in the Federal Register on August 29, 2024 and effective
as of September 30, 2024;</li>
<li>•  Requiring completing of line 36, Federal Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs;</li>
<li>•  Adding Department Temporary Rate and De Minimis Rate as a selection option under</li>
</ul>
<p>line 36(a), Indirect Cost Rate Type pursuant to Department guidance;
- •  Clarifying when to submit an Annual or Final report;
- •  Clarifying that the individual submitting the report, if not the certifying official, is
verifying that the certifying official has signed a physical copy of the form, and the
signed form is available upon request; and
- •  Making minor miscellaneous typographical edits.</p>
<p>This DCL rescinds and replaces the previous RSA-17 instructions, DCL-23-03, that RSA issued
on September 8, 2023. If you have any questions about completing the RSA-17, please contact
the Financial Management Specialist assigned to your agency.</p>

<h2 id="i-general-information">I.  General Information</h2>
<p>The RSA-17 is a cumulative report that captures the financial status of a specific Federal
VR grant award identified by the Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) in data
element A.1 (e.g., H126A230XXX) at a specific point in time. Recipients use the form to
report cumulative obligations and expenses that are calculated by adding all transactions
from the beginning of the period of performance for the award (i.e., beginning of the
reporting period) to the end of the reporting period specified on the RSA-17. This means
the Federal award data reported throughout the RSA-17, including but not limited to
those in Section B, Federal Funds, must specifically account for Federal award</p>
<p>drawdowns, disbursements, expenditures, obligations, and unobligated funds directly
associated with the FAIN identified in data element A.1.</p>
<p>Recipients are required to maintain supporting documentation to substantiate the financial
data reported on the RSA-17, as is true for any financial reports submitted by the
recipient (2 C.F.R. § 200.302(a)). Additionally, the recipient’s financial and accounting
systems must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by general and
program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures
adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes,
regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award (Id.). This means
recipients must ensure their supporting documentation identifies transactions that directly
tie to the FAIN identified in A.1, not just transactions that occurred during the reporting
period.</p>
<p>Typically, the RSA-17 will be available online the next working day after the end date of
the reporting period. A recipient is required to submit an RSA-17 report semi-annually</p>
<p>for every grant award’s period of performance, regardless of whether obligations or
expenses were incurred during any reporting period.</p>
<p>Once the award period has begun, a recipient is required to submit an RSA-17 report,
regardless of whether expenses were incurred. If expenses were not incurred during the
reporting period, the recipient must report zeros in the required data elements.</p>
<p>Agencies are responsible for having internal controls necessary to ensure RSA-17 data
are accurate, complete, reliable and submitted timely to RSA. Agencies may request that
an RSA-17 report be re-opened for revision. The RSA Financial Management Specialist
assigned to the recipient will review the request and, if necessary, place the form in an
edit status to permit the recipient to make changes.</p>
<p>It is particularly important that a recipient revise its 4th quarter RSA-17 report if any
accounting adjustments made after the report has been submitted change the amount of
expenditures reported as of the end of the 4th quarter reporting period. For example,</p>
<p>sometimes recipients may make accounting adjustments using journal vouchers to
reassign expenditures, already reported in a prior period, to another funding source (e.g.,
Federal or State). These adjustments, after the expenditure has been reported, would</p>

initial cost expenditure was made. If the initial expense was paid with non-Federal
funds, the applicable credit is applied to the fund from which the initial expenditure
was made (in other words, non-Federal funds). For expenses funded by both non-
Federal and Federal funds, the credit is applied to each funding source in proportion</p>

<p>For example, travel is considered obligated when the travel is taken, and personnel
expenditures for State agency employees are considered obligated when the employee
performs the services.</p>
<p>In determining when an obligation is made, recipients must also follow their State
laws, regulations, and policies and procedures, as applicable.</p>
<p>If the recipient has not met the requirements of Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act to
carry over Federal funds for obligation and expenditure in the subsequent fiscal year,
the recipient must incur all obligations, for which it has provided sufficient match
funds, by the end of the FFY of appropriation (i.e., September 30). In this
circumstance, the period of performance and the FFY of appropriation are the same.</p>
<p>If the recipient has met the carryover requirements by the end of the FFY of</p>
<p>appropriation, the period of performance will be extended to include the carryover
period (subsequent FFY). This will enable the recipient to incur new obligations
against Federal award funds during the carryover period, as indicated by the revised
period of performance on the GAN. In other words, in this circumstance, the period
of performance covers two FFYs – the FFY of appropriation plus the carryover year.</p>

<p>The Federal Funding Period in Box 6 of the GAN is the default entry. This data
element represents the period for which the funds were awarded</p>
<p>(34 C.F.R. § 77.1(c)). The Uniform Guidance uses the term “period of
performance” rather than “grant period.” Period of performance is defined in 2
C.F.R. § 200.1 in a manner like the EDGAR definition of “grant period.” A
recipient may neither obligate nor pay expenditures for costs of a grant award that
are incurred prior to the start of the period of performance. For example, the cost
for VR services provided to a consumer prior to the start of the period of
performance for a grant award may not be charged to that grant award. Rather,
those obligations must be charged to the prior grant award or another funding
source. Additionally, a recipient may not obligate award funds after the end of the
period of performance for a grant award but could make allowable accounting
adjustments to expenditures if permitted by State rules.</p>
<p>During the FFY of appropriation, the Federal Funding Period listed in Box 6 of
the GAN will be from October 1 to September 30 of that FFY. This represents the
one-year period for which the award is made and in which the recipient may incur
new obligations against the award. Section 19(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act
permits States to carry over Federal funds for obligation and expenditure in the</p>
<p>subsequent FFY provided certain conditions are met (see the Carryover Grant</p>
<h2 id="award-notification-attachment-for-additional-details-this-means-that-states">Award Notification Attachment for additional details). This means that States</h2>
<p>may carry over the matched portion of the unobligated balance of Federal funds
for one FFY beyond the FFY of appropriation so long as the conditions of Section
19 of the Rehabilitation Act were satisfied. For example, the FFY of appropriation
for FFY 2023 awards began on October 1, 2022, and ends on September 30, 2023.

<p>the State met the requirements necessary to carry over funds for obligation and

<p>Specify whether the recipient used a cash or accrual basis for recording Federal
and non-Federal grant award transactions that form the basis for the financial data
submitted on the RSA-17.</p>
<p>For cash basis accounting, expenses are recorded when they are paid. The
transaction remains at the obligation stage until the liability is eliminated by the
disbursement of cash (in other words, the liquidation of the obligation).</p>
<h2 id="accrued-expenditures-are-recorded-when-goods-or-services-are-received">Accrued expenditures are recorded when goods or services are received,</h2>
<p>regardless of when cash is received or paid. The accrual method of accounting
elevates an obligation to an expenditure once the liability to pay has been created,
as opposed to when the expenditure is actually paid.</p>
<p>A recipient must report expenditures using either a cash or accrual basis of
accounting (2 C.F.R. § 200.1). However, if a recipient changes from one basis of</p>
<p>accounting to another, the recipient must inform RSA of the change. To ensure
recipients are not utilizing separate bases of accounting for reports covering the
same period of performance, changes to a recipient’s basis of accounting should
coincide with the end of the period of performance for the grant award, thereby
ensuring consistency for the entire period of performance.</p>

<p>The default reporting period end date corresponds with the end of the required

the grant through the end of the reporting period. Therefore, the RSA-17 collects
cumulative data for the period of performance. An example is included in the

<p>Enter the total amount of program income received by the recipient under the VR
program as of the end of the reporting period. All program income received by the
VR program is to be reported as Federal program income earned. This means
that recipients must report, and use, program income earned under the VR
program as an addition to the Federal grant funds received under the VR</p>
<p>program (34 C.F.R. § 361.63(c)(3)(i)). In other words, recipients may not use

<p>Program income is considered received in the FFY in which the recipient receives
the funds (34 C.F.R. § 361.63 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.1). Therefore, the amount
reported should not change after the recipient submits its 4th quarter report for the
FFY of appropriation in which the program income is received. Any program
income received during the subsequent FFY, even if the recipient is operating

certain formula grant programs funded under the Rehabilitation Act, as permitted
by Section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.63(c)(2). The

<p>to program income received from SSA. There is no legal authority for the
recipient to transfer other forms of program income earned under the VR
program to another program for that program’s use. Therefore, only SSA
reimbursement program income transferred to other eligible programs can be
reported on lines 23 through 26. Each program receiving SSA payments for its
use must report the funds as program income received for that program.</p>
<p>For example, if the VR program receives $100,000 in SSA payments, but</p>
<p>transfers the entire amount to the Independent Living for Older Individuals who
are Blind (OIB) program, the VR program must report the receipt of the $100,000
on line 21 and the expenditure of those funds under line 24 below. In so doing, the
VR program would report that the funds were “disbursed” by reporting the
transfer on line 24, SSA Payments Transferred to the Independent Living Services
for Older Individuals who are Blind Program. In addition, in this example, the

<p>Program income from SSA payments transferred to other eligible programs is
restricted to the grant award year that corresponds to the FFY of appropriation in
which it was received in the VR program. For example, SSA payments received
in the VR program in FFY 2024 may be transferred to the OIB program for
expenditures and reporting purposes for its FFY 2024 OIB award. This means the
transfer may occur during the FFY 2024 grant year or, in rare circumstances and</p>
<p>when applicable, during the FFY 2024 carryover year of the OIB grant award,
which occurs in FFY 2025. In the rare event that the program income is expended
during the FFY 2024 carryover year (which occurs in FFY 2025), all program
income information must be reported as occurring during the FFY 2024 period of
performance, not the FFY 2025 grant award’s period of performance.</p>

<p>(1st through 4th Quarter)</p>
<p>Overview: Information from this section is used to ensure the recipient provides the
requisite cost share of non-Federal expenditures incurred during the FFY of
appropriation. At the end of the 4th quarter, the recipient’s non-Federal share is based
upon the sum of lines 28, Total Non-Federal Share of Expenditures (4th Quarter) and
29, Non-Federal Share of Unliquidated Obligations (4th Quarter). In using this
calculation, RSA includes the recipient’s unliquidated non-Federal obligations with the
expenditures. As such, the recipient’s non-Federal share of unliquidated obligations is
credited toward meeting the recipient’s match requirement. The match calculated by
adding the amounts on lines 28 and 29, as just described, at the end of the FFY of
appropriation (i.e., at the end of the 4th quarter), determines whether the recipient has</p>
<p>preliminarily satisfied its match requirement for the grant award and, thus, is able to
carry Federal funds over to the subsequent fiscal year to the extent such funds remain
available for obligation. In Section E below, recipients report the amount of
liquidations from the amount of non-Federal unliquidated obligations incurred in the
FFY of appropriation, as reported on line 29, but liquidated during the carryover year,
which will be used to determine the actual match for the award based on final report
data.</p>
<p>Third-party in-kind contributions are not an allowable source of non-Federal share
under the VR program and, therefore, should not be reported as non-Federal
expenditures (34 C.F.R. § 361.60(b)(2)).</p>

<h2 id="e-reporting-non-federal-share-in-the-carryover-year">E.  Reporting Non-Federal Share in the Carryover Year</h2>
<p>(5th through 8th Quarter)</p>
<p>Overview: As noted in Section D above, all non-Federal expenditures and obligations
used for match purposes must be incurred during the FFY of appropriation. During the
carryover year, the recipient must liquidate all unliquidated obligations reported on line
29 as having been incurred by the end of the FFY of appropriation but not liquidated by
that time. All unliquidated obligations reported on line 29 for match purposes, incurred
prior to the end of the FFY of appropriation, must be liquidated by the end of the
liquidation period for that award (i.e., 120 calendar days after the end of the 8th quarter
(period of performance)). However, RSA recognizes unliquidated obligations
sometimes fall through during the carryover year and must be cancelled or deobligated.
When this occurs, the recipient can no longer count those obligations toward satisfying</p>
<p>its match requirement.</p>
<p>If non-Federal unliquidated obligations from the end of the 4th quarter, needed to
carryover funds, are cancelled, but the recipient had access to additional non-Federal
funds prior to end of the 4th quarter, then the recipient may adjust its accounting records
to reassign Federal expenditures paid prior to the end of the FFY of appropriation to
non-Federal funds to increase the amount of non-Federal share the recipient reported as
incurred by the end of the FFY of appropriation. The recipient has the flexibility during
the carryover year to make accounting adjustments with respect to expenditures
incurred prior to the end of the FFY of appropriation to ensure it continues to satisfy its
non-Federal share and/or maintenance of effort requirement. Such accounting
adjustments must be consistent with the State and recipient policies/procedures and
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). As a result, based on the Final
RSA-17 report, the actual total match provided by a recipient is the sum of lines 28,</p>

<p>For recipients in States that met the requirements of Section 19 of the
Rehabilitation Act to carry over Federal funds, use line 32 to enter the amount of
liquidations from the amount of non-Federal unliquidated obligations reported on
line 29, Non-Federal Share of Unliquidated Obligations, of the recipient’s 4th
quarter RSA-17 report that were liquidated during a subsequent reporting period.
The amount reported on line 32 reflects only the non-Federal obligations that
were reported on line 29 as incurred on or prior to September 30 of the FFY of
appropriation, but which were not liquidated by that date; line 32 reflects the
amount of those reported unliquidated obligations that have been liquidated
during the carryover year. Recipients may not report new non-Federal
expenditures on line 32 (i.e., non-Federal expenditures incurred during the
carryover year should be reported on line 33). Non-Federal share can only be
counted as match when obligated by September 30 of the FFY of appropriation of</p>
<p>an award as indicated on line 29 of the recipient’s 4th quarter RSA-17 and
liquidated within 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for
that award.</p>
<p>Unliquidated obligations reported on the 4th quarter report (i.e., those that were
incurred during the FFY of appropriation) that are cancelled during the
carryover period, or otherwise not liquidated after the FFY of appropriation, may
not be used toward satisfying the match requirement for the FFY of appropriation
for that award because those obligations never came to fruition for the VR
program. This means, a recipient may not have access to its full Federal award for
obligation and use in the carryover year if there were no excess non-Federal
expenditures incurred prior to September 30 of the FFY of appropriation to cover
the loss of these unliquidated obligations that “fell through” in the carryover year.
Funds for obligations reported on line 29, Non-Federal Share of Unliquidated
Obligations, cancelled during the carryover period, may not be re-obligated or
liquidated for expenditures incurred during the carryover period and counted as</p>
<p>match for the period of performance for the award because, pursuant to Section 19
of the Rehabilitation Act, match must be satisfied by the end of the FFY of
appropriation in order to carry over funds to the subsequent year.</p>
<p>If non-Federal unliquidated obligations from the end of the 4th quarter, needed to
carryover funds, are cancelled, but the recipient had access to additional non-
Federal funds prior to end of the 4th quarter, then the recipient may adjust its
accounting records to reassign Federal expenditures paid prior to the end of the
FFY of appropriation to non-Federal funds to increase the amount of non-Federal
share the State reported as having incurred by the end of the FFY of
appropriation. This will result in a surplus of Federal cash on hand because
Federal funds previously used to pay for an expenditure have now been adjusted
to be paid with non-Federal funds. In this instance, the RSA-17 submitted by the
recipient for the 4th quarter of the FFY of appropriation must be revised to reflect
an increased non-Federal share of expenditures, line 28, and a decreased amount
of Federal expenditures, line 14. The recipient should ensure its internal controls</p>

<h2 id="f-indirect-expenses_1">F.  Indirect Expenses</h2>
<p>Indirect costs (2 C.F.R. § 200.1) are generally charged to Federal awards via an
approved indirect cost rate or cost allocation plan. Any recipient that wishes to claim
indirect costs under Federal grants through an indirect cost rate must prepare an indirect</p>
<p>cost rate proposal (2 C.F.R. § 200.1) and submit it to the cognizant Federal agency for
indirect costs for approval (2 C.F.R. part 200, Appendix VII, paragraph D). Recipients
claiming indirect expenses based on a cost allocation plan (2 C.F.R. part 200, Appendix
VII, paragraph F.3), rather than an indirect cost rate, must develop, document, maintain
for audit, or submit, as appropriate, a narrative cost allocation methodology for indirect
costs to the cognizant agency for review, negotiation, and approval. Recipients must
ensure internal controls are adequate to report indirect costs timely and accurately.</p>
<p>Note: Indirect costs will be reported in Section F, line 36 and Section G, Administrative
Expenditures, line 37, as well as the applicable Federal, Program Income, and non-
Federal sections (B, C and D). Cost allocation plan costs will not be reported in Section
F, line 36, but will be reported in Section G, Administrative line 37, as well as the
applicable Federal, Program Income, and non-Federal sections (B, C and D). However,
RSA requires grantees with either cost allocation plans or indirect cost rates to identify
the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs in line 36.</p>
