<h2 id="dear-colleagues">Dear Colleagues:</h2>
<p>As individuals with disabilities seek to achieve and excel in competitive integrated employment
(CIE), assistive technology (AT), from low-tech communication aids to sophisticated software,
has helped level the playing field. In addition to advances in AT, the field of vocational
rehabilitation (VR) is now navigating the impact that artificial intelligence (AI)1 can have in
supporting individuals with disabilities to achieve CIE. As President Biden said in his landmark
Executive Order 14110: Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial
Intelligence (EO 14110), responsible AI use has the potential to help solve urgent challenges,
while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure. Responsible AI
use and innovation, as explained in EO 14110, involves mitigating the risks of AI in order to
realize its benefits. Irresponsible or uninformed use could exacerbate societal harms such as
discrimination, bias, and disempowered workers. Recognizing this risk, EO 14110 tasked the
U.S. Access Board and other Federal agencies with identifying and developing possible solutions
to potential or existing civil rights concerns, accessibility barriers, and risks of AI, as well as
promoting and creating safe, equitable, and accessible AI.2</p>
<p>As the landscape of AI continues to evolve, I urge us all to commit to ensuring with outspoken
intention that individuals with disabilities are early and active participants in AI developments.
History has proven that in the technology industry’s rush to be first to market, accessibility for
individuals with disabilities is often an afterthought, a luxury to be added on later. In honor of
October’s National Disability Employment Awareness Month, I am pleased to celebrate the
value and talent individuals with disabilities add to America’s workplaces and economy,
including instances in which AI propels such opportunity.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Dear Colleague Letter is to encourage states to drive responsible AI
innovation focused on better serving individuals with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Services
Administration has identified three ways that AI has the potential to support individuals with
disabilities in achieving CIE and to solve urgent challenges in the field:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-vr-program-should-intentionally-support-the-ai-literacy-of-individuals-with">1. The VR program should intentionally support the AI literacy of individuals with</h2>
<p>disabilities and prepare interested individuals with disabilities for careers in AI.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-term-artificial-intelligence-or-ai-has-the-meaning-set-forth-in-15-usc-94013-a-machine-based-system">1 The term “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3): a machine-based system</h2>
<p>that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing
real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real
and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use
model inference to formulate options for information or action.</p>

<h2 id="intentionally-supporting-ai-literacy-and-preparing-for-careers-in-ai">Intentionally Supporting AI Literacy and Preparing for Careers in AI</h2>
<p>VR agencies should provide the services and supports necessary for individuals with disabilities
to gain the technical skills to achieve CIE in AI careers, such as machine learning or systems
engineering, if that is the individual’s choice. VR agencies play a key role in the skills training
and career development opportunities, including internships and apprenticeships, needed to
prepare individuals with disabilities to be competitive in this evolving job market.</p>
<h2 id="using-responsible-ai-to-support-cie-in-any-career-field">Using Responsible AI to Support CIE in Any Career Field</h2>
<p>AI has the potential to remove longstanding barriers to CIE in self-selected careers for
individuals with disabilities by providing needed accommodations and individualized support.
As examples, AI-enabled software applications using speech synthesis and braille, universal
design of AI tools that all employees use, and reasonable accommodations that leverage AI are
now available. AI may also serve as a tool to address known challenges, offer additional support
that may unlock an employee’s potential by reducing unknown barriers, and create expanded
opportunities for success.</p>

<ul>
<li>• The Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion (EARN) article,</li>

<p>Use of Artificial Intelligence to Facilitate Employment Opportunities for People with
Disabilities, notes a variety of ways that AI can facilitate employment opportunities for
individuals with disabilities.

<p>AI presents an opportunity to maximize the quality and efficiency of VR services. This can
include improvements to VR counseling and case management with the support of AI. An article
in The Rehabilitation Professional provides several examples, including that “AI algorithms have
been shown to enhance assessment and planning, resulting in more targeted and effective service
plans.”3 Washington State’s Department of Social and Health Services AI chatbot tool illustrates
opportunities for resources to improve customer service (DSHS’ Division of Vocational
Rehabilitation introduces Innovative Artificial Intelligence Tool). Other examples include remote
VR service delivery (Enhancing Remote VR Services with Smart Tech and AI).</p>

<p>It is critical that VR agencies, advocacy groups, and individuals with disabilities are co-creators
of policies, plans, and products that impact them. Similarly, these same individuals should be
involved in the ongoing refinement and implementation of these policies, plans, and products.
We have urgent challenges, and the individuals who we serve can benefit from responsible AI
innovation that aims to provide the support they need to be prosperous and productive. However,
this will only happen if we all work together to ensure that these emerging technologies are
developed and used in a safe and inclusive manner.</p>
<p>We expect to discuss this Dear Colleague letter and anticipate working together on responsible
AI use to support individuals with disabilities in the VR program at future gatherings with
stakeholders. I look forward to championing the inclusion of individuals with disabilities at the
forefront of the AI revolution. May we all draw on the words of inventor Lewis Howard Latimer:
“[w]e create our future, by well improving present opportunities.”</p>
