<h2 id="dear-colleagues">Dear Colleagues,</h2>
<p>The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is transmitting a copy of the Vocational</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Financial Report (RSA-17) and instructions for completing the form for the State
Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Services program. The Office of Management and Budget
- (OMB) has approved this form (OMB Control No. 1820-0017) through August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The RSA-17 collects data on VR program activities for agencies funded under the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended by title IV of the Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act (WIOA). RSA uses the data to evaluate and monitor the financial and
programmatic performance of VR agencies. The RSA-17 captures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Federal and non-Federal administrative expenditures for the VR program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Federal and non-Federal expenditures for Services to Groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Federal and non-Federal American Job Center Infrastructure expenditures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Receipt, use, and/or transfer of VR program income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Financial data necessary to ensure Federal award requirements are met (e.g., those for
match, maintenance of effort, and the reservation of funds for the provision of pre-
employment transition services); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Obligations and disbursements that occurred during the period of the award.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data collected via the RSA-17 are necessary to ensure Federal requirements imposed by the
Rehabilitation Act and its implementing Federal regulations are satisfied. The attached document
shows the applicable portions of the Rehabilitation Act that necessitate the reporting of the data
collected by the RSA-17.</p>
<p>The RSA-17 will be effective for the VR program for new VR grant awards issued on or after
October 1, 2020 (Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2021). The RSA-17 form will replace the RSA-2 and</p>
<p>SF-425 submissions for these awards. The RSA-17 will collect quarterly cumulative VR
financial data on an award-by-award basis.</p>

<h2 id="i-general-information">I.  General Information</h2>
<p>The RSA-17 is a cumulative report that captures the financial status of a grant award at a specific
point in time. Grantees use the form to report cumulative expenses that are calculated by adding
all expenses from the beginning of the period of performance for the award (i.e., beginning of the
reporting period) to the end of the reporting period specified on the RSA-17.</p>
<p>Agencies are required to maintain supporting documentation to substantiate the financial data
reported on the RSA-17, as is true for any financial reports submitted by the grantee (2 C.F.R. §
200.302(a)). Additionally, the agency’s financial and accounting systems must be sufficient to
permit the preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms and conditions;
and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have
been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the</p>
<h2 id="federal-award-id">Federal award (Id.).</h2>
<p>The RSA-17 will be available online the next working day after the end date of the reporting
period. A grantee is required to submit an RSA-17 report quarterly for every grant award’s
period of performance, regardless of whether expenses were incurred during any particular</p>
<p>quarterly reporting period. If expenses were not incurred during a particular quarter of the period
of performance, the grantee should report a zero for the appropriate line items.</p>
<p>Forms must be submitted electronically through the RSA Management Information System
(RSAMIS). In addition, grantees should maintain a hardcopy of the report, signed by the
certifying official, for verification purposes.</p>
<p>To enter data into this form online, visit https://rsa.ed.gov. To enter data, individuals must have a
user ID. If you do not have a user ID, the procedures for obtaining one are located at:</p>
<p>https://rsa.ed.gov/help/technical-support</p>
<p>Agencies are responsible for having internal controls necessary to ensure RSA-17 data are
accurate and reliable upon submission to RSA. Agencies may request, through the RSAMIS, that
an RSA-17 report be opened for revision. The RSA Financial Management Specialist assigned to
the agency will review the request and, if necessary, place the form in an edit status to permit the
grantee to make changes. It is particularly important that an agency revise its 4th quarter RSA-17
report if any accounting adjustments made after the report has been submitted change the
amounts reported as of the end of the 4th quarter reporting period. For example, sometimes
agencies may make accounting adjustments using journal vouchers to reassign expenditures,
already reported in a prior period, to another funding source (e.g., Federal or State). These
adjustments after the expenditure has been reported would require revisions to the previously
submitted financial reports based upon when the obligation or expenditure was incurred.</p>
<p>If any of the information in pre-populated or calculated data fields is inaccurate, please contact
the RSA Financial Management Specialist assigned to your agency.</p>

<ul>
<li>A.  Allowable Cost — A cost incurred by a grantee that is (1) reasonable and necessary for
the performance of the award; (2) allocable; (3) in conformance with any limitations or
exclusions set forth in the Uniform Guidance; (4) consistent with regulations, policies,
and procedures of the grantee for both Federally-supported and other activities of the</li>
</ul>
<p>organization; (5) accorded consistent treatment as a direct or indirect cost; (6)
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and (7) not
included as a cost in any other Federally-supported award (unless specifically
authorized by statute) (2 C.F.R. § 200.403). Only allowable VR program costs are to be
reported on the RSA-17.</p>
<ul>
<li>B.  Applicable Credits — Applicable credits are those receipts or reduction-of-expenditure
type transactions that offset or reduce expense items allocable to the Federal award as
direct or indirect (i.e., facilities and administration (F&amp;A)) costs. Examples of such
transactions include purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or
indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments
or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the non-
Federal entity relate to allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award
either as a cost reduction or a cash refund (2 C.F.R. § 200.406(a)). The applicable credit
must be applied to the Federal fiscal year (FFY) from which the initial cost expenditure
was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the initial expense was paid with non-Federal funds, the applicable credit should be
applied to the fund from which the initial expenditure was made (in other words, non-
Federal funds). For expenses funded by both non-Federal and Federal funds, the credit
should be applied to each funding source in proportion to the initial amounts paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>C.  Carryover — The unobligated balance of authorized Federal funds that a grantee may</li>
</ul>
<p>obligate and expend in a subsequent FFY provided the grantee met the matching
requirements by the end of the FFY of appropriation (Section 19 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended (Rehabilitation Act) and 34 C.F.R. § 361.64).</p>
<h2 id="section-19a1-of-the-rehabilitation-act-permits-grantees-to-carry-over-federal-funds">Section 19(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act permits grantees to carry over Federal funds</h2>
<p>for obligation and expenditure in the subsequent FFY provided certain conditions are
met, as described further below. This means that grantees may carry over the
unobligated balance of Federal VR funds for one FFY beyond the FFY of appropriation</p>

<p>so long as the conditions of Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act were satisfied. For
example, the FFY of appropriation for FFY 2021 awards begin on October 1, 2020 and
will end on September 30, 2021. The carryover period for FFY 2021 awards will start
on October 1, 2021 and will end on September 30, 2022.</p>

program since there is no authority under the Rehabilitation Act or its
implementing regulations for subawarding, also known as subgranting
(34 C.F.R. § 76.50). Additionally, third-party in-kind contributions are not an
allowable source of non-Federal share under the VR program and, therefore,
should not be reported as non-Federal expenditures (34 C.F.R. § 361.60(b)(2)).</p>
<p>For financial reports prepared on a cash basis, expenditures are the sum of actual cash
disbursements for direct charges for goods and services and the amount of indirect
expense charged.</p>
<p>For financial reports prepared on an accrual basis, expenditures are the sum of actual

period from October 1 through September 30. For example, the FFY 2020 State

contracts and subawards made, and similar transactions during a given period that
require payment by the non-Federal entity during the same or a future period
(2 C.F.R. § 200.71). There is no authority for subawards, as defined in 2 C.F.R. §
200.92, under the VR program. Additionally, the future period in which obligations
may be liquidated is limited by Federal requirements and the terms and conditions
applicable to the award.</p>

<p>For example, travel is considered obligated when the travel is taken, and personnel
expenditures for State agency employees are considered obligated when the employee
performs the services. In determining when an obligation is made, agencies must also
follow their State laws, regulations, and policies and procedures, as applicable.</p>
<p>If the grantee has not met the requirements of Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act to
carry over Federal funds for obligation and expenditure in the subsequent fiscal year,
the grantee must incur all obligations, for which it has provided sufficient match funds,
by the end of the FFY of appropriation (i.e., September 30). In this circumstance, the
period of performance and the FFY of appropriation are the same.</p>
<p>If the grantee has met the carryover requirements by the end of the FFY of
appropriation, the period of performance will be extended to include the carryover
period (subsequent FFY). This will enable the grantee to incur new obligations against
Federal award funds during the carryover period, as indicated by the revised period of
performance on the Grant Award Notification (GAN). In other words, in this
circumstance, the period of performance covers two FFYs – the FFY of appropriation</p>
<p>plus the carryover year.</p>
<ul>
<li>I.  Period of Performance — The time during which the non-Federal entity (grantee) may
incur new obligations to carry out the work authorized under the Federal award
(2 C.F.R. § 200.77). The Department, as the Federal awarding agency, must include
start and end dates of the period of performance in the Federal award. For purposes of

<ul>
<li>
<p>K.  Reporting Period — The time period for which the grantee reports financial
information on any given report. For example, for purposes of the 4th quarter report, the
reporting period covers the period from October 1 through September 30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L.  Unliquidated Obligations — For financial reports prepared on a cash basis,
unliquidated obligations are obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity that have not
been paid (in other words, liquidated). For reports prepared on an accrual expenditure
basis, these are obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity for which an expenditure
has not been recorded (2 C.F.R. § 200.97).</p>

<p>grantee may neither obligate nor pay expenditures for costs incurred prior to the
start of the period of performance. For example, the cost for VR services provided
to a consumer prior to the start of the period of performance for a grant award
may not be charged to that grant award. Rather, those obligations must be charged
to the prior grant award. Additionally, a grantee may not obligate award funds
after the end of the period of performance for a grant award.</p>
<p>During the FFY of appropriation, the Federal Funding Period listed in Box 6 of
the GAN will be from October 1 to September 30 of that FFY. This represents the
one-year period for which the award is made and in which the grantee may incur
new obligations against the award. Section 19(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act
permits grantees to carry over Federal funds for obligation and expenditure in the
subsequent FFY provided certain conditions are met, as described further below.
This means that grantees may carry over the unobligated balance of Federal funds</p>
<p>for one FFY beyond the FFY of appropriation so long as the conditions of Section
19 of the Rehabilitation Act were satisfied. For example, the FFY of appropriation
for FFY 2018 awards began on October 1, 2017 and ended on September 30,</p>

<p>Upon submission of the grantee’s 4th quarter RSA-17 (which is for the reporting

Management Specialist will review the grantee’s report to determine whether the
grantee met the requirements necessary to carry over funds for obligation and
liquidation in the subsequent FFY. If the grantee met the requirements of Section
19 of the Rehabilitation Act to carry over funds, RSA will process an
administrative change to the current GAN extending the period of performance to

<p>Specify whether the grantee used a cash or accrual basis for recording Federal and

<p>For cash basis accounting, expenses are recorded when they are paid. The

disbursement of cash (in other words, the liquidation of the obligation).</p>
<h2 id="accrued-expenditures-are-recorded-when-goods-or-services-are-received">Accrued expenditures are recorded when goods or services are received,</h2>
<p>regardless of when cash is received or paid. The accrual method of accounting

as opposed to when the expenditure is actually paid.</p>
<p>A grantee must report using either a cash or accrual basis of accounting.
However, if a grantee changes from one basis of accounting to another, the
grantee must inform RSA of the change. To ensure grantees are not utilizing
separate bases of accounting for reports covering the same period of performance,</p>
<p>changes to an agency’s basis of accounting should coincide with the end of the

<p>FFY of appropriation in which the program income is received. Any program
income received during the subsequent FFY, even if the agency is operating under
a carryover year from the prior FFY’s grant award, must be reported on the RSA-
17 for the next FFY’s grant award.</p>
<p>While the program income received by the VR grantee from the Social Security
Administration (SSA) is entered on line 21, the expenditure of the program
income is reported below on lines 22 through 26 as appropriate. For example, if
the VR program receives $100,000 in SSA payments and expends those funds in
the VR program, the VR grantee must include the $100,000 on line 21 and then
report the expenditure of those on line 22.</p>
<p>A VR grantee may choose to transfer SSA payments received by the VR program
to certain formula grant programs funded under the Rehabilitation Act, as
permitted by Section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.63(c)(2).
The authority to transfer program income received from SSA in accordance with</p>
<h2 id="section-108-of-the-rehabilitation-act-and-34-cfr-36163c2-is-unique-only">Section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.63(c)(2) is unique only</h2>
<p>to program income received from SSA. There is no legal authority for the VR
agency to transfer other forms of program income earned under the VR program
to another program for that program’s use. Each program receiving SSA
payments for its use must report the funds as program income received for that
program.</p>
<p>For example, if the VR program receives $100,000 in SSA payments, but
transfers the entire amount to the Independent Living for Older Individuals who
are Blind (OIB) program, the VR program must report the receipt of the $100,000
on line 21 and the expenditure of those funds under line 24 below. In so doing, the
VR program would report that the funds were “expended” by reporting the
transfer on line 24, VR SSA Payments Transferred to the Independent Living
Services for Older Individuals who are Blind Program. In addition, in this
example, the OIB program would report the program income on its SF-425 line
10l as received, report the program income as transferred from the VR program in
the Remarks section on line 12, Remarks, on its own SF-425.</p>
<p>Program income from SSA payments transferred to other eligible programs is
restricted to the grant award year that corresponds to the FFY of appropriation in
which it was received in the VR program. For example, SSA payments received
in the VR program in FFY 2021 may be transferred to the OIB program for</p>
<p>expenditures and reporting purposes for its FFY 2021 OIB award. This means the
transfer may occur during the FFY 2021 grant year or, in rare circumstances and
when applicable, during the FFY 2021 carryover year of the OIB grant award,
which occurs in FFY 2022. In the rare event that the program income is expended
during the FFY 2021 carryover year (which occurs in FFY 2022), all program
income information must be reported as occurring during the FFY 2021 period of
performance, not the FFY 2022 grant award’s period of performance.</p>

<p>(1st through 4th Quarter)</p>
<p>Overview: Information from this section is used to ensure the VR agency provides the
requisite cost share of allowable non-Federal expenditures incurred during the FFY of</p>
<p>appropriation. At the end of the 4th quarter, the agency’s non-Federal share is based
upon the sum of lines 28, Total Non-Federal Share of Allowable Expenditures (4th</p>
<h2 id="quarter-and-29-non-federal-share-of-allowable-unliquidated-obligations-4th">Quarter) and 29, Non-Federal Share of Allowable Unliquidated Obligations (4th</h2>
<p>Quarter). In using this calculation, RSA considers the agency’s allowable unliquidated
non-Federal obligations to be expenditures incurred at the time the agency incurred the
obligation to pay the cost with non-Federal funds consistent with 34 C.F.R. § 76.707.
As such, the agency’s non-Federal share of allowable unliquidated obligations are
credited toward meeting the agency’s match requirement. The match calculated by
adding the amounts on lines 28 and 29, as just described, at the end of the FFY of
appropriation (i.e., at the end of the 4th quarter), determines whether the agency has
satisfied its match requirement for the grant award and, thus, is able to carry Federal
funds over to the subsequent fiscal year to the extent such funds remain available for
obligation. In Section E below, VR agencies will report the amount of liquidations from
the amount of non-Federal unliquidated obligations incurred in the FFY of
appropriation, as reported on line 29, but liquidated during the carryover year, which
will be used to determine the actual match for the award based on final report data.</p>

<p>If non-Federal unliquidated obligations from the end of the 4th quarter, needed to

funds prior to end of the 4th quarter, then the grantee may adjust its accounting records
to reassign Federal expenditures paid prior to the end of the FFY of appropriation to
non-Federal funds to increase the amount of non-Federal share the State reported as
having incurred by the end of the FFY of appropriation. The agency has the flexibility
during the carryover year to make accounting adjustments with respect to expenditures
incurred prior to the end of the FFY of appropriation to ensure it continues to satisfy its
match requirement. Such accounting adjustments must be consistent with the State and
agency policies/procedures and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). To

qualify for carrying over Federal funds because it did not satisfy the

during the carryover year, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 76.707. The amount
reported on line 33 must not include the liquidation of obligations that were
incurred during the FFY of appropriation, and reported on line 29, but liquidated
during the carryover year and reported on line 32. The non-Federal expenditures
reported on line 33, if any, will not count toward the prior FFY of appropriation’s</p>
<p>match requirement, but will count toward the current FFY’s MOE requirement.</p>
<p>For example, State A incurs sufficient non-Federal expenditures by the end of the
FFY of Appropriation for FFY 2019 to carry over unexpended Federal funds into
the subsequent FFY (FFY 2020) for obligation and use in accordance with</p>
<h2 id="section-19-of-the-rehabilitation-act-even-though-state-a-provided-sufficient">Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act. Even though State A provided sufficient</h2>
<p>non-Federal expenditures during FFY 2019 to match the Federal funds carried
over, as the State continues to spend in the carryover year, the State’s accounting
system still divides every expenditure incurred during the carryover year of FFY
2020 into its Federal share (78.7 percent) and non-Federal share (21.3 percent).
Although these non-Federal expenditures are incurred under the FFY 2019 VR
grant award, the non-Federal expenditures incurred in FFY 2020 must be
reported, for MOE purposes, on line 33 of the RSA-17 for FFY 2019 to ensure
they are included for FFY 2020 MOE purposes.</p>

<p>Indirect costs (2 C.F.R. § 200.5) are generally charged to Federal awards via an
approved indirect cost rate or cost allocation plan. Any State grantee that wishes to
claim indirect costs under Federal grants through an indirect cost rate must prepare an
indirect cost rate proposal (2 C.F.R. § 200.57) and submit it to the cognizant Federal
agency for approval (2 C.F.R. part 200, Appendix VII, paragraph D). State grantees
claiming indirect expenses based on a cost allocation plan (2 C.F.R. part 200, Appendix
VII, paragraph F.3), rather than an indirect cost rate, must develop, document, maintain
for audit, or submit, as appropriate, a narrative cost allocation methodology for indirect
costs to the cognizant agency for review, negotiation, and approval. Grantees with
indirect cost rates that change between State fiscal years must use separate rows for
each approved indirect cost rate applicable to expenditures incurred during the period
of performance.</p>

<p>Infrastructure expenditures for AJCs are defined as non-personnel costs that are
necessary for the general operation of the one-stop center, including: rental of the
facilities; utilities and maintenance; equipment (including assessment-related and
assistive technology for individuals with disabilities); and technology to facilitate
access to the one-stop center, including technology used for the center’s planning
and outreach activities (WIOA sec. 121(h)(4), 34 C.F.R. § 361.700). This list is</p>
<p>not exhaustive. For example, expenditures for the development and use of the
common identifier (i.e., AJC signage) and supplies, as defined in the Uniform
Guidance at 2 C.F.R. § 200.94, used to support the general operation of the one-
stop center, may be considered allowable infrastructure expenditures. It is
important to note that VR funds used to pay for the VR program’s proportional
