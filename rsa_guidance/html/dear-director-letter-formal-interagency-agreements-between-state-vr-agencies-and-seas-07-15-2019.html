<h2 id="dear-director">Dear Director:</h2>
<p>To support States to enter into formal interagency agreements between State vocational
rehabilitation (VR) agencies and State educational agencies (SEAs) and to foster collaboration
between these agencies, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and
Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), in
collaboration with the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), is providing you with a
review instrument for the formal interagency agreement between SEAs and VR agencies, as
required by Section 101(a)(11)(D) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV of
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), and 34 C.F.R. § 361.22(b).</p>
<p>The Rehabilitation Act and its regulations require VR agencies to enter into formal interagency
agreements with SEAs describing how the entities will collaboratively plan and coordinate
transition services for students with disabilities needing those services. This formal interagency</p>
<p>agreement is an important foundational document that helps to ensure students with disabilities
experience a smooth transition from school to post-school activities. The Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) also requires that the SEAs and VR agencies plan and
coordinate transition services for students who receive special education services (Section
612(a)(12) of the IDEA and 34 C.F.R. § 300.154). VR agencies have the flexibility to include
local educational agencies (LEAs) as parties to the formal State interagency agreement, or to
execute formal interagency agreements with LEAs that are consistent with the State-level
agreement and address the required provisions of the formal interagency agreement.</p>
<p>OSERS hopes you find the attached review instrument helpful when developing and updating, as
applicable, the formal interagency agreement between VR agencies and SEAs regarding
workforce preparation activities and employment services. It offers strategies and resources to
increase collaboration between the State and local agencies under these two programs, as well as
program providers, so they may more effectively serve students and youth with disabilities.
OSERS supports SEAs, LEAs, and VR agencies as they use the flexibility afforded under the
IDEA and Rehabilitation Act to engage in innovative strategies, involving students and youth</p>
<p>with disabilities and their families, in the transition process as early as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the attached review instrument, the National Technical Assistance Center on
Transition (NTACT) and Workforce Innovation Technical Assistance Center (WINTAC) have
jointly issued an Interagency Agreement Toolkit to provide technical assistance on the
development of the formal interagency agreement between the VR agencies and SEAs.</p>
<h2 id="additional-resources-include">Additional resources* include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  A Transition Guide to Postsecondary Education and Employment for Students and Youth
with Disabilities (Transition Guide). As a student approaches the time to leave high
school, it is important that preparations for adult life are well underway. The Transition
Guide, developed by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and
Rehabilitative Services, is a resource for students and families to use during the transition
planning process and may assist with the identification of needs and available services.</li>

training and technical assistance to State VR agencies on the new statutory requirements
contained in the Rehabilitation Act. The WINTAC develops and provides training and
technical assistance to State VR agency staff and related rehabilitation professionals and
service providers to help them develop the skills and processes needed to meet the
requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. Resources developed specific to the development
of the SEA agreement include: WINTAC-NTACT Interagency Toolkit Guide (updated
July 10, 2017); Introduction to Formal interagency Agreement Toolkit; Discussion</li>

potential impact on shared student data, timelines and priorities, as well as how agencies
can support student outcomes and improve agency performance.</p>
