<p>For the Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit and Median Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit
performance indicators, the Departments have determined it is appropriate and reasonable to
assess performance for the WIOA title I and III core programs. The Departments have
determined it is appropriate to use their transition authority to delay assessment of (1)</p>
<p>performance for WIOA title II and IV core programs, (2) the remaining primary performance
indicators for WIOA title I and III core programs, and (3) the Overall State Program and
Indicator Scores for all core programs. The Departments will not impose associated sanctions on
a State for PYs 2020 and 2021 when the available baseline data are not sufficient to produce
reliable estimates using the statistical adjustment model. However, States still must submit
timely and complete performance reports and will be sanctioned for failure to do so. If a State is
unable to submit complete and timely performance reports by the deadlines due to exceptional
circumstances outside of the State’s control, it must notify the Departments pursuant to 20 C.F.R.
§ 677.185(c) and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.185(c) and 463.185(c) and consistent with guidance set forth
in TAC 20-02. The practical implications of the Departments’ decision on sanctions
implementation are explained in a series of questions and answers below.</p>

<p>programs and reporting requirements that assess States’ effectiveness in achieving positive
outcomes for individuals and employers served by WIOA’s six core programs.2 WIOA also
requires that the Departments use a statistical adjustment model to assess State performance by
adjusting negotiated performance levels for the characteristics of participants actually served
throughout the program year and for the actual economic conditions within the State. WIOA
requires the Departments to use the model to assess State performance and determine whether a
State has failed to meet its adjusted levels of performance. The Departments developed a model
and process3 for this purpose. To date, the implementation of a model and the performance
accountability provisions have informed the Departments’ performance negotiations with States
and technical assistance efforts and have advanced the workforce system toward a more</p>
<p>objective and data-driven accountability structure.</p>
<p>WIOA instituted a new approach to performance accountability in the workforce system, and the
Departments find it is taking longer to collect sufficient baseline data to produce reliable
estimates for certain performance indicators and for certain core programs than had been
anticipated. The Departments are doing everything they can to collect performance data and
promote robust practices related to data collection, data integrity, and complete reporting. As
additional data are collected, the Departments will continue to review and refine the statistical
adjustment model. Section 503(a) of WIOA authorizes the Secretaries of Education and Labor to
take such action as appropriate to provide for the orderly transition from any requirement under
WIA to those under WIOA, including those related to the performance accountability system
established in section 116 of WIOA. The Departments have determined that it would be
inappropriate to assess for performance pursuant to section 116(b)(3)(A) of WIOA and 20 C.F.R.
§ 677.190, and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.190 and 463.190, and to impose sanctions pursuant to section
116(f) of WIOA, on a State on the basis of a statistical adjustment model for which the available
baseline data are not sufficient to produce reliable estimates.</p>
<p>Use of WIOA’s transition authority to delay assessing performance and imposing sanctions is an
appropriate action for an orderly transition to the WIOA performance accountability system,
because of the performance accountability system’s reliance on the statistical adjustment model.
Therefore, the Departments determined that it is reasonable to use the WIOA transition authority
of section 503(a) of WIOA to delay assessing performance and imposing sanctions against States
that fail to meet adjusted levels of performance for those Individual Indicator Scores, as well as
for the Overall State Program Score and the Overall State Indicator Score, for which the baseline
data are not sufficient. For more information on the Departments’ determination, please review</p>

<p>The Departments have determined it is appropriate for DOL to begin assessing performance for
two performance indicators under WIOA title I and III core programs for PYs 2020 and 2021 in
accordance with the phased-in approach to performance assessments as described in TAC 20-02.
The Departments, as permitted under section 503(a) of WIOA, will delay assessing performance
for the purpose of imposing sanctions for the remaining performance indicators. The following
questions and answers explain what this means in practical terms.</p>
<p>Q1: For which primary indicators of performance and for which core programs will the</p>
<h2 id="departments-assess-performance-for-py-2020-and-py-2021">Departments assess performance for PY 2020 and PY 2021?</h2>
<p>The Departments will assess performance only for the Individual Indicator Scores for two
indicators – Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit and Median Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit
– for the WIOA title I and III core programs. See Attachments I and II for additional</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>Q2: Can States be sanctioned for a performance failure of WIOA title I and III core program</p>
<h2 id="individual-indicator-scores-for-py-2020-and-py-2021">Individual Indicator Scores for PY 2020 and PY 2021?</h2>
<p>Yes. If a WIOA title I or III core program fails to achieve an Individual Indicator Score of at
least 50%, as described on page 11 of TAC 20-02, for either the Employment Rate 2nd Quarter
after Exit or Median Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit indicators in PY 2020 or PY 2021, the State
must receive technical assistance and develop a program improvement plan in accordance with
section 116(f)(1)(A) of WIOA. If the State fails the same indicator for a second consecutive
program year (for example, in PY 2021), the Departments must impose a financial sanction in
accordance with section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA.</p>
<p>Q3: Will the Departments suspend WIOA performance reporting for PY 2020 and PY 2021?</p>
<p>No, States are still required to submit complete and timely performance information as they have</p>
<p>been since PY 2016.</p>
<p>Q4: Will States be subject to sanctions for failure to submit complete and timely reports for PY
2020 or PY 2021?</p>
<p>Yes, States are subject to sanctions for failure to submit complete and timely performance
reports for all six core programs. Failing to certify complete annual performance reports by
October 1 could lead to a financial sanction of the following program year’s funds. For details
regarding complete and timely reporting and requesting an annual reporting extension, refer to
pages 8-10 of TAC 20-02.</p>
<p>Q5: If not using it to assess performance, how will the Departments use performance data from</p>
<h2 id="pys-2020-and-2021">PYs 2020 and 2021?</h2>
<p>The Departments will continue to use the data for the purposes of effective program
management, system oversight, monitoring and internal controls, and the provision of technical</p>
<p>assistance, including implementing methods for ensuring data reliability, as appropriate. The</p>
<p>3</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<p>Departments will share performance results with States as appropriate. States should expect to
review performance data for these program years and prepare to engage with Federal staff to
discuss topics including but not limited to, data quality, continuous improvement, and
performance results.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-wioa-transition-authority-for-individual-indicator-scores">Use of WIOA Transition Authority for Individual Indicator Scores</h2>
<p>For purposes of the WIOA title I and III core programs (the Adult, Dislocated Worker, and
Youth formula programs, and the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Services program) the
Departments have determined that the statistical adjustment model is yielding reliable results for
two of the employment-related indicators – Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit and Median
Earnings 2nd Quarter after Exit – for purposes of assessing the Individual Indicator Score,
pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 677.190(c)(5), for all four of these core programs. Therefore, the
Departments have determined there is no need to use the transition authority of section 503(a) of
WIOA for purposes of delaying assessing the individual indicator score for these two indicators</p>
<p>for the Titles I and III core programs.</p>
<p>However, the Departments have determined that the baseline data for the other indicators and
core programs are not sufficient for the statistical adjustment model to yield consistently reliable
results. For these performance indicators and programs, more baseline data are necessary for the
model to yield reliable results. Therefore, the Departments have determined it necessary to use
the transition authority of section 503(a) of WIOA in PYs 2020 and 2021 to delay assessing
performance and imposing sanctions for:
- •  the other four performance indicators for the Titles I and III programs, pursuant to 20</p>
<h2 id="cfr-677190c5-and">C.F.R. § 677.190(c)(5); and</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  all six performance indicators for the Title II Adult Education and Family Literacy Act</li>
<li>(AEFLA) and the Title IV Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs, pursuant to 34</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cfr-361190c5-and-463190c5">C.F.R. §§ 361.190(c)(5) and 463.190(c)(5).</h2>
<p>Use of WIOA Transition Authority for Overall State Indicator Score and Overall Program</p>
<h2 id="score_1">Score</h2>
<p>While the model is yielding reliable results for the Employment Rate in 2nd Quarter after Exit
and the Median Earnings in 2nd Quarter after Exit indicators for the Titles I and III programs, the
Departments have concluded it would not be reasonable to assess an Overall State Indicator
Score, as required by 20 C.F.R. § 677.190(c)(4) and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.190(c)(4) and
463.190(c)(4), solely on the basis of the limited available data because such a score would not be
an accurate representation of the State’s overall performance on either of the indicators,
particularly as the only available data comes from just one agency. Similarly, the Departments
have determined it would not be reasonable to assess an Overall State Program Score by taking
into account only the two indicators for which there are reliable data (20 C.F.R. § 677.190(c)(2)
and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.190(c)(2) and 463.190(c)(2)). Such results would not be representative of
the Titles I and III programs’ performance as a whole in the State when there are four other
indicators not included in the calculation for each of those programs. Therefore, the Departments
have determined it necessary to use the transition authority of section 503(a) of WIOA to delay</p>
<p>assessing performance for Overall State Indicator Scores and Overall State Program Scores and
for imposing sanctions for any State that fails in accordance with 20 C.F.R. § 677.190(d)(1) and</p>
