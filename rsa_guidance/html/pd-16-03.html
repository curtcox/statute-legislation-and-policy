<h2 id="policy-background">POLICY:        Background</h2>
<p>WIOA requires the Governor of each State to submit a Unified or
Combined State Plan to the Secretary of Labor that includes a four-year
strategy for the State’s workforce development system. States must have
Federally-approved State Plans in place to receive funding for the six core
programs. At a minimum, States must submit a Unified State Plan, which
encompasses the six core programs under WIOA. States have the option to
submit a Combined State Plan, which includes the six core programs of the
Unified State Plan, plus one or more other partner programs, described at
the Unified and Combined State Plan Options section of this PD. For
purposes of the Unified or Combined State Plans, the term “State” refers to
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and, as
appropriate for certain programs, the Republic of Palau.</p>
<h2 id="unified-and-combined-state-plan-options">Unified and Combined State Plan Options</h2>
<p>A State has two options for submitting a WIOA State Plan: a Unified State
Plan or a Combined State Plan. Section 102(a) of WIOA requires each
State, at a minimum, to submit a Unified State Plan that fosters strategic
alignment of the core programs, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>•  the Adult program (Title I),</li>
<li>•  the Dislocated Worker program (Title I),</li>
<li>•  the Youth program (Title I),</li>
<li>•  the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (Adult Education or</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aefla-program-title-ii">AEFLA) program (Title II),</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  the Wagner-Peyser Act program (Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended
by title III), and</li>
</ul>
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program (Title I of the</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rehabilitation-act-of-1973-as-amended-by-title-iv">Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV).</h2>
<p>In addition, WIOA permits a State to submit a Combined State Plan
including the aforementioned core programs plus one or more of the</p>
<h2 id="combined-state-plan-partner-programs-listed-in-section-103a2-states">Combined State Plan partner programs listed in section 103(a)(2). States</h2>
<p>choosing to submit a Combined State Plan must incorporate (1) all of the
common planning elements required in the Unified State Plan; (2)
additional elements describing how the State will coordinate the optional
programs with the core programs; and (3) additional elements required by
the Combined State Plan partner program(s) that are included (WIOA sec.
103(b)(3)).</p>
<p>More specifically, when a State includes a Combined State Plan partner
program in its Combined State Plan, the State need not submit a separate
plan or application for that particular program, with certain exceptions
identified in the Special Considerations for Combined State Plan Partner
Programs section of this PD. If included in the plan as a partner,</p>
<h2 id="combined-state-plan-programs-are-subject-to-the-common-planning">Combined State Plan programs are subject to the “common planning</h2>
<p>elements” (Sections II-IV of the State Plan Requirements in the Unified
and Combined State Plan Information Collection Request (ICR) discussed
in the Planning Requirements section of this PD) and program-specific
requirements for that program when such planning requirements exist
separately for the program outside of WIOA. The Combined State Plan
partner programs are—</p>

<p>principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>•  Increase access to and opportunities for the employment, education,

<li>•  Align workforce investment, education, and economic development
systems in support of a comprehensive, accessible, accountable, and</li>
</ul>
<p>high-quality workforce development system;
- •  Improve the quality and labor market relevance of workforce
investment, education, and economic development efforts;
- •  Promote improvement in the structure and delivery of services;
- •  Increase the prosperity of workers and employers, the economic
growth of communities, regions, and States, and the global
competitiveness of the United States;
- •  Provide innovative workforce investment activities, through
integrated workforce development systems, that increase
employment, retention, and earnings of participants and that
increase postsecondary credential attainment and, as a result,
improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency,</p>
<p>increase economic self-sufficiency, meet skill requirements of
employers, and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the
nation; and
- •  Measure effectiveness, improve transparency, and support informed
consumer choice through performance reporting, evaluation, and
data systems that support these activities.</p>
<h2 id="plan-structure">Plan Structure</h2>
<p>The Departments envision that this plan will describe how the State will
develop and implement a unified, integrated workforce system, rather than
a plan that separately discusses the State’s approach to operating each
program individually. The major content areas of the Unified or Combined</p>
<h2 id="state-plan-include-strategic-and-operational-planning-elements-wioa">State Plan include strategic and operational planning elements. WIOA</h2>
<p>separates the strategic and operational elements to facilitate cross-program
strategic planning. The Strategic Planning and Operational Planning
Elements are the “common elements” of the plan. They should incorporate
all of the core programs, any Combined State Plan partner programs that
are included and required one-stop partners. This new approach enables
States to involve different levels of the workforce system in developing the</p>
<p>appropriate sections of the plan. For example, the State Workforce
Development Board may focus on developing the State vision or setting
strategic direction in the Strategic Plan section, while the State agency may</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>focus on the Operational Plan.</p>
<p>The Strategic Planning Elements of the Unified or Combined State Plan
must include an analysis of the State’s current economic environment and
identification of the State’s overall vision for its workforce development
system, including analyses of the State’s workforce characteristics and
workforce development activities. These analyses drive the required vision
and goals for the State’s workforce development system and alignment
strategies for workforce development programs to support economic
growth. For Combined State Plans, the Strategic Planning Elements apply
to Combined State Plan partner programs included in the plan as well as to
all of the core programs.</p>
<h2 id="the-operational-planning-elements-section-identifies-the-states-planned">The Operational Planning Elements section identifies the State’s planned</h2>
<p>actions to implement and support the State’s strategic vision and goals as
identified in the Strategic Planning Elements section. This section ensures
that the State has the necessary infrastructure, policies, and activities to
meet its strategic goals, implement its alignment strategy, and support
ongoing program development and coordination. The State Operational
Plan must elaborate on the Strategic Plan section relating to the State’s
plans and resources for an aligned and integrated workforce system by
discussing how the programs included in the State plan will serve various
individual participants. For instance, the State Operational Plan should
discuss how services for employers and various job seekers will be
delivered. Similarly, the State Plan must also describe the State’s plans to
align data systems and support evaluations. The structure of the</p>
<h2 id="operational-planning-elements-in-the-law-and-icr-is">Operational Planning Elements in the law and ICR is:</h2>
<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>b. Workforce programs operate within the context of a regional labor
market. States must use reliable labor market information and
workforce information as the basis for the development of policies,
strategic investments, program design, and service delivery, in order</li>
</ul>
<p>to ensure that customers have high quality information available to
inform their decisions. The State Plan must include a description of
the labor market and economic conditions in the State to identify
critical industries, including population and workforce trends, and
describe the economic challenges facing the State that need to be
addressed to meet the needs of businesses, workers, and job seekers.
Strategies and program decisions at the State and local levels should
be based on, connected to, and aligned with the labor market trends
and economic analysis. The professional analysis of available data
should result in labor market relevant goals, strategies, and planned
outcomes that make an impact on regional labor markets, and that
advance the economic prosperity of customers served.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>c. Strategic and Operational Planning Elements should also reflect a

strengths, and weaknesses; their capacity to serve the needs of
businesses and individuals; their current level of cross-program
alignment; and their use of evidence-based practices.</p>

<h2 id="the-information-collections-for-the-program-specific-portion-of-the-state">The information collections for the program-specific portion of the State</h2>
<p>plans for the Combined State Plan partner programs will continue to exist
under existing state planning ICRs for those programs, as governed by
those programs’ authorizing legislation. Once a Combined State Plan is
approved, the State is not required to submit any other State plan to receive
federal funding for any optional program covered under that Combined</p>
<h2 id="state-plan-with-some-exceptions-described-below">State Plan, with some exceptions described below.</h2>
<p>Note that some of the other programs that a State may include in the</p>
<h2 id="combined-state-plan-currently-fulfill-their-program-specific-state-planning">Combined State Plan currently fulfill their program-specific State planning</h2>
<p>requirements through a separate information collection administered by the
program’s appropriate Department. For example, section 103(b)(2) of</p>
<h2 id="wioa-referring-to-sec-103a2j-and-k-specifically-allows-the">WIOA (referring to sec. 103(a)(2)(J) and (K)) specifically allows the</h2>
<p>employment and training activities, rather than the full program, carried out
under the CSBG Act administered by HHS and employment and training
activities funded by HUD to be included in a WIOA Combined State Plan.
Therefore, if States choose to include programs such as these in the</p>
<h2 id="combined-state-plan-only-the-portion-of-the-existing-planning">Combined State Plan, only the portion of the existing planning</h2>
<p>requirements that address the employment and training activities should be
included in the Combined State Plan. States still must submit all other
required elements of a complete State Plan for those programs directly to
the relevant Departments.</p>
<p>Portions of the Combined State Plan covering a program or activity,
excluding those related to the core programs, are subject to approval by the
head of the Federal agency that administers such program (WIOA sec.</p>
<p>103(d)(2)). The portions of the Combined State Plan related to the core
programs are subject to the same approval requirements applicable to the</p>
<h2 id="unified-state-plan">Unified State Plan.</h2>
<p>States that include UI in their Combined State Plan, carried out under Title
III, Section 302 of the Social Security Act, including Sections 303(a)(8)
and (9) which govern the expenditure of funds, should submit their UI State
Quality Service Plan (SQSP) following the cycle as outlined in the current</p>
<h2 id="et-handbook-no-336-ui-sqsp-planning-and-reporting-guidelines">ET Handbook No. 336, UI SQSP Planning and Reporting Guidelines.</h2>
<p>The Jobs for Veterans State Grant (JVSG) programs, carried out under
chapter 41 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, require both a JVSG State Plan and
a separate annual application for funding. States that include the JVSG</p>
<p>10</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-11">Page 11</h2>
<p>programs in their Combined State Plan would submit the JVSG State Plan
information in their Combined State Plan, and would submit their funding
applications annually, as required by current VETS guidance.</p>
<p>For Combined State Plans, the common elements of the State Plan and
those portions covering the core programs and programs administered by
DOL or ED, will be considered approved 90 days after receipt, unless
either Secretary informs the State in writing, during the 90-day period, that
the plan is inconsistent with WIOA’s State Plan requirements or the
requirements authorizing the core program, as appropriate. Those portions
of the plan covering programs administered by HUD, USDA and HHS
must be approved or disapproved within 120 days of receipt by those</p>
<h2 id="departments-for-the-six-core-programs-decisions-regarding-approval-or">Departments. For the six core programs, decisions regarding approval or</h2>
<p>disapproval and funding status may be determined separately from the
determination of approval, disapproval, or completeness of the program-
specific requirements of Combined State Plan partner programs and
activities described in the Combined State Plan. For example, if all the
common planning elements and program-specific requirements for the core
programs are met, approval and funding may proceed regardless of specific
issues that may be identified in the program-specific sections for any</p>

<p>the planning process. State Workforce Development Boards are
responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and
modification of the plan, and for convening all relevant programs, required
partners, and stakeholders. The State Plan must be developed with the
assistance of the State Board, as required by sec. 101(d) of WIOA, and
must be developed in coordination with administrators that have optimum
policymaking authority for the core programs and required One-Stop
partners. For Combined State Plans, entities responsible for planning or</p>
<p>administering other programs included in the plan also must have an
opportunity for review and comment.</p>
<h2 id="effective-joint-planning-is-fundamental-to-both-unified-and-combined">Effective joint planning is fundamental to both Unified and Combined</h2>
<p>State Plans. Whether the State chooses to submit a Unified State Plan or a
Combined State Plan, the State must develop the State Plan through joint
planning and coordination across core programs, and with required One-
Stop partner programs and other programs and activities in the State Plan.
Prior to submitting the Unified or Combined State Plan, the State agencies
responsible for the administration of the core programs must have reviewed
and commented on the appropriate operational planning portion of the State
Plan, and approved the elements as meeting the needs of the population
served by such programs (see WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(E)(iii)(I)).</p>

<h2 id="instructions-for-plan-submission">Instructions for Plan Submission</h2>
<p>For the initial four-year Unified and Combined State Plans (covering the
period July 1, 2016-June 30, 2020), States must submit their Unified or
Combined State Plans to the Departments by March 3, 2016; however,
Plans submitted by April 1, 2016, will be considered timely.3 States must
submit the Plans via the online portal hosted by the Rehabilitation Services
Administration (RSA), which allows the entire State Plan to be available
concurrently to DOL and ED, as well as other Departments if their
programs are included. The submission portal is available along with other</p>
<h2 id="state-plan-resources-at">State Plan resources at</h2>
<p>https://rsa.ed.gov/login.cfm?mode=form&amp;usp=Y#skipnav. Instructions on
how to request State user accounts are available on the web link provided
on this site. The Departments will provide training on the portal to State
users, and Federal staff will be available to provide basic technical</p>
<p>guidance and to authorize individuals from the States to have read-only,
and/or edit access to the State Plan portal, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The portal will permit multiple users within a State to enter portions of the
State’s plan at the same time, thereby allowing program partners to enter
content that is common to all State plan partners, as well as content that is
specific to their program directly. In States where there is a separate VR
program serving the blind, each VR program must complete a separate VR
services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan. Once State users</p>

<h2 id="page-13">Page 13</h2>
<p>enter all data and text into the portal, they may review the plan in its
entirety, make edits and updates where needed, and view progress in
entering plan information across programs. While multiple individuals in
the State may enter content into the portal, only one individual may submit
the entire plan on behalf of all included programs through the portal for
Federal review. The portal includes a certification that the official State
“submitter” has the authority to do so.</p>
<p>States that include the Perkins program as part of their Combined State
Plans will submit to the WIOA State Plan Portal their currently approved</p>
<h2 id="perkins-state-plan-including-any-revisions-the-state-determines-are">Perkins State Plan, including any revisions the State determines are</h2>
<p>necessary. The portal will then redirect States from the WIOA State Plan
Portal via a link to the Perkins State Plan portal. On the Perkins State Plan</p>
<p>portal, States will submit: (1) Request to Extend Perkins State Plan; (2)
updated budget, and (3) proposed performance levels for the upcoming
program year. ED will provide State Career and Technical Education</p>

<p>Employment and Training (E&amp;T) as part of their Combined State Plan will
submit their SNAP E&amp;T specific State Plans into the WIOA State Plan
portal, but must submit component details, participant levels, operating
budget and fiscal year planned program costs to their Food and Nutrition</p>
<h2 id="service-fns-regional-office">Service (FNS) Regional Office.</h2>
<h2 id="performance-negotiations">Performance Negotiations</h2>
<p>Separately, DOL and ED will disseminate joint guidance on the WIOA
performance negotiation process. For the first Plan, the Departments will
work with States during the negotiation process to establish the adjusted
levels of performance for each of the primary indicators for the core
programs. If necessary, some may be adjusted after the release of the final</p>
<p>regulation and Joint Performance ICR. Additionally, DOL and ED
acknowledge that for some indicators for certain core programs there is
insufficient, or no historical data available on which to build the required
statistical adjustment model and consequently establish levels of
performance using the statistical model as part of the negotiation process.
Therefore, DOL and ED will use a “phased-in” approach to set levels of
performance for certain indicators for certain programs. The appendix in
the Unified and Combined State Plan ICR discussed in the Unified and
Combined State Plan Options section of this PD and in Attachment II of
this PD reflects this approach and displays which indicators/programs DOL
and ED have proposed to negotiate for PY 2016. See Attachment II of this</p>

<h2 id="page-14">Page 14</h2>
<h2 id="state-plan-modifications">State Plan Modifications</h2>
<p>Given the multi-year life of the State Plan, States must revisit State Plan
strategies regularly, reassess their effectiveness and labor market relevance,
and, where needed, recalibrate these strategies to respond to the changing
economic conditions and workforce needs of the State. At a minimum,
States must submit a modification to the Unified or Combined State Plan at
the end of the first two-year period of any four-year plan, and under
specific circumstances described in sec. 102(c)(3)(A) of WIOA.</p>
<h2 id="the-departments-have-determined-that-for-any-combined-state-plan">The Departments have determined that for any Combined State Plan</h2>
<p>program included in the plan with a different planning cycle from WIOA,</p>
<h2 id="states-should-submit-program-specific-modifications-that-align-with-the">States should submit program-specific modifications that align with the</h2>
<p>natural planning cycles for that specific program, unless the 2-year WIOA
modification cycle can accommodate that program’s planning and</p>
<p>modification cycle. For example, if a State chooses to include Career and
Technical Education Programs under the Perkins Act, as a part of its</p>
<h2 id="combined-state-plan-the-state-would-submit-program-specific-plan">Combined State Plan, the State would submit program-specific plan</h2>
<p>modifications annually to align with the Perkins Act’s annual State plan
cycle. Such modifications must be submitted to the relevant Secretary for
that program directly, in addition to DOL and ED via the web portal. As
another example, the TANF law requires a State to have submitted a plan
within 27 months of the end of the first fiscal quarter in order to receive
TANF funds for that fiscal year. Therefore, adopting the more frequent 2-
year WIOA cycle for modifications should accommodate TANF’s cycle,
allowing a State to make all changes to each portion of the Combined State
Plan concurrently. In its Combined State Plan, the State may choose to
describe in the State Plan the planning cycles of the Combined State Plan
programs. In addition, the State may describe intentions to submit future
modifications to comply with those planning cycles. HHS intends to
publish separate guidance that outlines how a State could align its WIOA
and TANF plan renewal cycles.</p>
<h2 id="special-instructions-for-single-area-states">Special Instructions for Single-Area States</h2>
<p>Item VI (d) in the Title I program-specific State Plan requirements (in the</p>
<p>Unified and Combined State Plan ICR discussed in the Unified and
Combined State Plan Options section of this PD) is directed at Single-Area
States. It requires them to “submit any information required in the local
plan” with the submission of its State Plan. DOL is exercising its transition
authority provided in WIOA sec. 503 to delay the requirement that Single-
Area States include a local plan with their initial four-year State Plan
submission until DOL provides guidance to those specific States.</p>

<p>Each State submitting a Unified or Combined Plan is required to identify expected levels of
performance for each of the primary indicators of performance for the first two years covered by
the plan. The State is required to reach agreement with the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction
with the Secretary of Education on state adjusted levels of performance for the indicators for each</p>
<p>of the first two years of the plan. To effect an orderly transition to the performance accountability
system in Section 116 of the WIOA, the Departments will use the transition authority under
WIOA sec. 503(a) to designate certain primary indicators of performance as “baseline” indicators
in the first plan submission. A “baseline” indicator is one for which States will not propose an
expected level of performance in the plan submission and will not come to agreement with the
Departments on adjusted levels of performance. “Baseline” indicators will not be used in the end
of the year performance calculations and will not be used to determine failure to achieve adjusted
levels of performance for purposes of sanctions. The selection of primary indicators for the
designation as a baseline indicator is made based on the likelihood of a state having adequate data
on which to make a reasonable determination of an expected level of performance and such a
designation will vary across core programs.</p>
<p>States are expected to collect and report on all indicators, including those that that have been
designated as “baseline”. The actual performance data reported by States for indicators
designated as “baseline” in the first two years of the Unified or Combined Plan will serve as
baseline data in future years.</p>
<p>Each core program must submit an expected level of performance for each indicator, except for
those indicators that are listed as “baseline” indicators below.</p>
<p>For the first Plan, the Departments will work with States during the negotiation process to
establish the adjusted levels of performance for each of the primary indicators for the core
programs. If necessary, some may be adjusted after the release of the final regulation and Joint</p>

<h2 id="information-system-fapiis-notice_1">Information System (FAPIIS) Notice</h2>
<p>On July 22, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget issued final guidance, 80 FR 43301, that
amends 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Guidance) to implement the requirement that Federal agencies
review information available in FAPIIS, the Federal government’s designated integrity and
performance system, prior to issuing new grant awards. The Department is also required to
report to FAPIIS information about existing awards that are terminated on or after January 1,
2016, due to material failure to comply with Federal award terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In accordance with these requirements, if your State Plan is approved and the total award amount,</p>
<p>for this fiscal year, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000), the
following applies under 2 CFR 200.205(a)(2):</p>
<h2 id="1-before-the-award-is-made-the-department-will-review-and-consider-any-information-about">1. Before the award is made, the Department will review and consider any information about</h2>
<p>your agency that is in FAPIIS, which is accessible through the System for Award
Management (SAM). You may review and comment on any information about your
agency that may have been entered previously and that is currently in FAPIIS. In making a
judgment about your agency’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under
Federal awards – and, thus, in making our final determination of any risk posed by your
agency as a grantee – the Department will consider the information in FAPIIS, including
any comments made by you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>2 CFR part 200 Appendix XII requires agencies to report to FAPIIS any information about
criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new
information to provide. This disclosure applies if the total value of your agency’s
currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Federal Government, including any funds received under this State Plan, exceeds
$10,000,000. Please review the specific requirements in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix XII,
for greater details regarding this reporting obligation if your agency receives Federal funds
exceeding the $10,000,000 threshold.</p>
<h2 id="grant-award-notification-access">Grant Award Notification Access</h2>
<p>The Department may mail you a Grant Award Notification (GAN); or send you an email
containing a link to access the GAN in G5, the Department’s Grant Management System. The
email will be sent to both the Recipient State Director and the Authorizing Representative in order
for them to view and print the PDF version of the electronically signed GAN. If neither the
Recipient State Director nor Authorizing Representative is registered in G5, they will
immediately be prompted to register once the link is accessed. The electronic signature and
issuance of the GAN makes it crucial that you provide correct email addresses for both the</p>
