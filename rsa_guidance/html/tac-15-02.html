<h2 id="innovation-and-opportunity-act">Innovation and Opportunity Act</h2>
<p>PURPOSE:       The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) represents the
first major reform of the publicly-funded workforce development system
in more than 15 years. Title IV of WIOA amends the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) by significantly revising requirements for,
among others, the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VR) program,
particularly with regard to its role as a core partner in the workforce
development system. WIOA fosters new opportunities for innovation and
collaboration across Federal, State, and local agencies, private
organizations, and employers. The law authorizes increased access to
employment, education, training, and support services to assist individuals</p>
<p>with disabilities, including youth and students with disabilities, to succeed
in the competitive labor market. To that end, the VR program is a critical
component in the workforce development system. Through this technical
assistance circular (TAC), the Rehabilitation Services Administration
- (RSA) sets forth the vision for the VR program as a partner in the
workforce development system by describing a framework to support
implementation activities that will help workers with disabilities to acquire
the skills and credentials they need to pursue in-demand jobs and obtain
competitive integrated employment.</p>
<h1 id="technical">TECHNICAL</h1>
<h1 id="assistance">ASSISTANCE:</h1>
<p>The purpose of title I of the Rehabilitation Act is to assist each State in
operating a statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and

<p>Vision for the State VR Program as a core program under WIOA</p>
<p>As a core partner in the one-stop service delivery system, the State VR
program provides individuals with disabilities the services they need to
compete for and achieve high-quality employment in the 21st century
global economy. While individuals with disabilities are a vital and
integral part of our society, some individuals with disabilities face
particular barriers to high-quality employment. RSA envisions the State</p>

<p>partners to assist workers with disabilities by providing them with the
necessary services and supports so that they can acquire the skills and
credentials that they need to have the opportunity to pursue in-demand
jobs and careers. In so doing, the State VR program’s leadership in the
one-stop system is critical to growing our economy, ensuring that
everyone who works hard is rewarded, and building a strong middle class.</p>

<p>disabilities are provided a full opportunity through the VR program
to engage in job-driven training and pursue high-quality
employment outcomes. For example, by providing VR services,
including financial support for graduate-level degrees to
individuals pursuing career advancement or by serving, outside of
an order of selection, individuals with disabilities who are in
immediate danger of losing employment, VR agencies can
maximize the potential for individuals with disabilities to prepare
for, obtain, retain, and advance in the same high-quality jobs and
high demand careers as persons without disabilities.</p>
<h2 id="wioa-enhances-the-vr-agencies-ability-to-coordinate">WIOA enhances the VR agencies’ ability to coordinate,</h2>
<p>collaborate, and work with employers, as well as with other entities

of VR program participants. WIOA enhances opportunities for VR
agencies to provide needed training and technical assistance
services to employers hiring, or interested in hiring, individuals
with disabilities, including the availability of work-based learning
experiences that prepare individuals with disabilities, including
students and youth with disabilities, for success in competitive

<p>4</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>limitations on the payment of subminimum wages to individuals
with disabilities added by section 511, demonstrate the intent that
individuals with significant disabilities, especially youth, must be
afforded a full opportunity to prepare for, obtain, maintain,
advance in, or re-enter competitive integrated employment. To
that end, VR agencies should coordinate the delivery of services to
youth with disabilities, especially youth with the most significant
disabilities, with other providers in the State who serve this
population to ensure they receive the necessary services and
supports to achieve competitive integrated employment.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) Expanding services to support the transition of students and youth

<p>and employment.</p>
<h2 id="while-the-vr-program-has-always-provided-transition-services-to">While the VR program has always provided transition services to</h2>
<p>eligible students with disabilities, the Rehabilitation Act, as
amended by WIOA, expands the population eligible to receive
certain discrete services and permits a wider range of services to
students who are transitioning from school to post-school
activities. Section 113 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that VR
agencies reserve at least 15 percent of their VR allotment to
coordinate with local educational agencies in providing, or
arranging for the provision of, pre-employment transition services
to students with disabilities who are eligible or potentially eligible
for VR services and in need of such services. In addition, the</p>
<h2 id="rehabilitation-act-permits-the-provision-of-transition-services-for">Rehabilitation Act permits the provision of transition services for</h2>
<p>the benefit of groups of youth with disabilities. Because of these
amendments, VR agencies now have an opportunity to provide VR</p>
<p>services to a broader population of students and youth with
disabilities to assist them in preparing for and obtaining
competitive integrated employment. VR agencies should work
with State and local educational agencies to ensure that the
services provided are coordinated and seamless across the various
programs that support transition for students and youth with
disabilities from secondary education to postsecondary education
and employment.</p>

<p>enactment of WIOA. This would include policies related to:
eligibility determination; development of the IPE; the provision of
services to students and youth with disabilities transitioning from
secondary education to postsecondary education and work; the
provision of supported employment services to individuals with the
most significant disabilities; the implementation of an order of

<p>services provided with reserved VR funds versus another VR
service provided with the remainder of VR funds.</p>
<p>  Expand partnerships with employers. To improve and enhance
employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, VR
agencies should expand outreach activities to employers and
potential employers, including enhancing opportunities for work-
based learning experiences, such as internships and
apprenticeships, for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>  Prepare for fiscal and program changes. VR agencies should
assess their case management systems to determine their capacity
to document the services and funding levels now required under</p>
<p>the Rehabilitation Act, including the reservation of VR funds for
the provision of pre-employment transition services to students
with disabilities.</p>
<p>  Build new and strengthen existing partnerships. WIOA requires</p>
<h2 id="states-and-local-areas-to-enhance-coordination-and-partnerships">States and local areas to enhance coordination and partnerships,</h2>
<p>including through the Unified or Combined State Plan, with local
entities and supportive service agencies for strengthened service
delivery. These plans should: include statutorily specified
additional partners in the planning process; establish a set of
common performance measures that apply to all core programs;
strengthen linkages between complementary programs, including
providing access to services within the one-stop center system; add
one-stop center partners, such as the Carl D. Perkins Career and</p>
<h2 id="technical-education-program-at-the-secondary-and-postsecondary">Technical Education program at the secondary and postsecondary</h2>
<p>level and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</p>
<p>program; and specify partner programs’ support for one-stop
system infrastructure costs and other shared costs.</p>
<p>  Develop plans to ensure workforce development boards become</p>

<p>membership requirements and be able to carry out new functions

<h2 id="workforce-development-board-is-critical-to-the-transition-to">Workforce Development Board is critical to the transition to</h2>
<p>requirements under WIOA, as the State Board plays a significant
role in overseeing transition activities, including the designation of

the development of criteria for local board appointments, and the</p>

<p>recertify boards. Additionally, as also noted in DOL TEGL No.
19-14, when establishing standing committees, States are strongly
encouraged to focus on serving youth, low-skilled adults,</p>
<h2 id="american-indians-individuals-with-disabilities-and-other-priority">American Indians, individuals with disabilities, and other priority</h2>
<p>groups in the local area.</p>
<p>  Engage with core programs and other partners to begin strategic
planning. DOL TEGL No. 27-14 also encourages local and State
leaders to engage in strategic planning and find new ways to align
core programs, optional programs under a Combined State Plan,
and required and optional one-stop partners under WIOA. It is
vital to understand the new Unified or Combined State Plan
requirements and to assess whether States have the right partners at</p>
<p>the table and are participating fully as equal partners in the design
and coordination of the programs and services within the
workforce development system. Strategic planning should include
concrete goals as well as a vision of success, i.e., how the
workforce development system should function in the State to best
meet WIOA’s goals. Local and State leaders are encouraged to
include State economic development staff and support alignment
of workforce and economic development goals.</p>
<p>  Develop transition plans. Transition to the requirements imposed
by WIOA, and reaching its vision, is complex and will require
substantial activities. We encourage States to develop transition
plans to facilitate and promote preparation and tracking of
transition and implementation progress. Additionally, transition
plans could be helpful to guide State implementation of WIOA
requirements, and identify possible impacts on program</p>
<p>participants affected by WIOA. The Departments will be
developing technical assistance tools to assist State VR agencies
and relevant core partners in this effort.</p>
<p>  Reassess one-stop delivery system. With other WIOA partners,
such as other core programs, optional programs, and required and
optional one-stop partners, VR agencies should reassess the one-
stop delivery system and what is needed to achieve seamless
service delivery models that place the individual, especially
individuals with disabilities, in the center of program design and
delivery. Consider operations, such as “bricks and mortar” and
information technology infrastructure, in light of new core and
required one-stop center partners. WIOA requires a memorandum
of understanding (MOU) between the local board and the one-stop
partners to address one-stop center infrastructure funding, physical
and programmatic accessibility requirements, and the vision of</p>

<h2 id="page-10">Page 10</h2>
<p>how the VR program can partner with the one-stop centers to
ensure the one-stop centers are physically and programmatically
accessible to help individuals overcome barriers to becoming and
staying employed, to support applicable career development
services, such as initial assessment of skill levels through the one-
stop delivery system, as well as how individuals with disabilities,
especially VR-eligible individuals, will benefit from a more
integrated one-stop system. These actions will better position State</p>
