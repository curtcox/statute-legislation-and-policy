<h1 id="policy">POLICY:</h1>
<p>Through this Policy Directive (PD), the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is
transmitting a copy of the revised RSA-911 for the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)
Services and State Supported Employment Services programs. The Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) has approved this information collection (OMB control number 1820-0508) until</p>
<h2 id="april-30-2022">April 30, 2022.</h2>
<h2 id="implementation-timeline">Implementation Timeline</h2>
<p>The attached version of the RSA-911, in Attachment II, becomes effective July 1, 2020, when
State VR agencies must begin collecting RSA-911 data consistent with RSA-PD-19-03 for</p>
<p>program year (PY) 2020. State VR agencies will continue to submit RSA-911 data in accordance
with RSA-PD-16-04, dated June 14, 2017, for the remainder of PY 2018 and the entirety of</p>
<h2 id="py-2019-july-1-2019-through-june-30-2020">PY 2019 (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020).</h2>
<p>In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.12, State VR agencies must implement policies and
procedures that ensure the proper and efficient administration of the VR program, including
those necessary to carry out all functions for which the State is responsible under this program.
So that each State VR agency is able to collect and report on the revised RSA-911 by July 1,
2020, each State VR agency’s internal controls should ensure that its:</p>

<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<h2 id="use-of-rsa-911-data">Use of RSA-911 Data</h2>
<p>RSA uses the data collected through the RSA-911 to describe the performance of the VR and
Supported Employment programs in the Annual Report to the Congress and the President as
required by Sections 13 and 101(a)(10) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as
amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). RSA also uses these data
to assess the performance of the VR program through the calculation of evaluation standards and
performance indicators as required by Section 106 of the Rehabilitation Act, which must be
consistent with the common performance accountability measures established in Section 116 of
Title I of WIOA for the core programs of the workforce development system. In addition, RSA
uses data reported through this data collection to support its other responsibilities under the
Rehabilitation Act. RSA uses data captured through the RSA-911 during the conduct of the
annual reviews and periodic onsite monitoring of VR agencies required by Section 107 of the</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Act to examine the effectiveness of program performance. Other important
management activities, such as the provision of technical assistance, program planning, and
budget preparation and development, are greatly enhanced through the use of RSA-911 data. In
addition, RSA uses RSA-911 data in the exchange of data under a data sharing agreement with
the Social Security Administration as required by Section 131 of the Rehabilitation Act. Finally,
the RSA-911 data is used widely by researchers for disability-related analyses and reports.</p>
<h2 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>State VR agencies must submit RSA-911 data to RSA on a quarterly basis, no later than 45 days
after the end of each quarter in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<h2 id="1-reporting-period-july-1-september-30">1. Reporting Period: July 1 – September 30</h2>
<h2 id="report-due-november-15">Report Due: November 15</h2>
<h2 id="2-reporting-period-october-1-december-31">2. Reporting Period: October 1 – December 31</h2>
<h2 id="report-due-february-15">Report Due: February 15</h2>
<h2 id="3-reporting-period-january-1-march-31">3. Reporting Period: January 1 – March 31</h2>
<h2 id="report-due-may-15">Report Due: May 15</h2>
<h2 id="4-reporting-period-april-1-june-30">4. Reporting Period: April 1 – June 30</h2>
<h2 id="report-due-august-15">Report Due: August 15</h2>
<p>So that a State VR agency can be considered to have met the data submission requirement, the
data must be submitted in accordance with the timeline above and be accurate. Data submissions
that are submitted by the due date but are returned for correction will not be considered timely
submissions. State VR agencies must submit the report covering the period July 1, 2020, through
September 30, 2020, to RSA no later than November 15, 2020.</p>
<h2 id="electronic-submission">Electronic Submission</h2>
<p>Each VR Director will receive a user ID and password necessary to access the RSA-911 data
portal via RSA’s website, https://rsa.ed.gov. The VR Director will be responsible for ensuring
submission and certification of the RSA-911 data on a quarterly basis. The VR Director may
formally delegate this responsibility to another individual who is authorized to certify the data</p>
<p>on behalf of the VR agency. End users will be required to reset the password periodically for</p>
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p>security purposes. When uploading data, the RSA-911 upload webpage will capture the
following:
- •  Name of Individual Submitting Data: Entered by end user
- •  Title of Individual Submitting Data: Entered by end user
- •  Phone Number for Individual Submitting Data: Entered by end user
- •  Email Address for Individual Submitting Data: Entered by end user
- •  Date Report Submitted: No data entry required</p>
<p>End users will follow the RSA-911 data portal prompts to upload the data file. Prior to the
submission of the data, the VR Director or the individual formally delegated the authority to
submit the data on his or her behalf will be required to certify the following statement:</p>
<p>By submitting this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report
is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures reported are for the purposes and
objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any
false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may
subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false
claims or otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="data-element-sequence">Data Element Sequence</h2>
<p>The RSA-911 Data Elements have been categorized to indicate the point in the VR or supported
employment process when the data should be collected. The Data Elements are designed to</p>
<p>collect information at that particular point (e.g., application, eligibility). By collecting and
reporting applicable data at the correct point in the VR process, State VR agencies help to ensure
data validity.</p>
<p>State VR agencies must submit a comma delimited data file through the RSA-911 data portal.
Although some elements may be left blank, a comma delimited space must be included for each
Data Element in each submission. The element number refers to the location of the reported
response in the comma delimited text string (e.g., the second comma delimited position in the
text file is for the Social Security Number).</p>
<p>The RSA-911, issued in RSA-PD-16-04, includes a total of 393 Data Elements. Through RSA-
PD-19-03, RSA has deleted 94 Data Elements and has added 14 new Data Elements. As a result,
the revised RSA-911 includes a total of 313 Data Elements. Because of these revisions, the
revised RSA-911 now includes 94 Data Elements wherein State VR agencies are not to report
any data. For example, RSA has deleted Data Element 3 (Date Report Submitted) in the revised
RSA-911 covered by this PD. Thus, State VR agencies will leave Data Element 3 blank.</p>
<p>The 14 new Data Elements are numbered 394 through 407. For example, RSA has added a new
Data Element titled Monthly Public Support at Application; this is Data Element 394 in the
revised RSA-911. For a complete list of the revisions RSA made to the RSA-911, please see</p>

<h2 id="each-data-element-has-an-associated-type-that-serves-as-a-guide-for-submitting-valid-values">Each Data Element has an associated type that serves as a guide for submitting valid values:</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  VARCHAR n: Data can include any letters or numbers with a maximum length defined
by “n.” All variable character (VARCHAR) Data Elements that require numbers use only
positive numbers.</li>
<li>•  DATE (YYYYMMDD): Data can include dates in the eight-digit format of year, month,
and day. All dates reported on the RSA-911 must be in the format of (YYYYMMDD),
where (YYYY) is year, (MM) is month and (DD) is day. For Year (YYYY), record the
calendar year using all four digits of the year (e.g., 2019). For Month (MM), record the</li>
</ul>
<p>months using two digits (e.g., 01 for January). For Day (DD), record the day of the month
using two digits. When the day is a single digit, add a "0" prefix (e.g., 04).
- •  Decimal n,x: Data can include a decimal number with a total of number of “n” digits, of
which “x” can be after the decimal point.
- •  INT n: Data can include any integer (whole number) with a maximum length of integers
as defined by “n.” All integers must be positive.</p>
<h2 id="data-reporting-requirements">Data Reporting Requirements</h2>
<p>The data comprising the RSA-911 are mandated by the Rehabilitation Act. Applicable portions
of the Rehabilitation Act explicitly or implicitly require the collecting and reporting of specific
Data Elements by State VR agencies to RSA for the VR and Supported Employment programs.
In addition, reporting requirements to support the performance accountability system under</p>
<h2 id="section-116-of-title-i-of-wioa-are-applicable-to-the-vr-program-as-one-of-the-six-core-programs">Section 116 of title I of WIOA are applicable to the VR program, as one of the six core programs</h2>
<p>of the workforce development system. Section 116 requires the reporting of data needed to</p>
<p>calculate State performance on the primary indicators of performance for the core programs. In
addition, States must report information on barriers to employment for participants under each of
the core programs.</p>
<p>In accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.150(a)(1), for purposes of the VR program, an individual
is a “participant” if he or she has an approved individualized plan for employment (IPE) and
has begun receiving VR services. A “reportable individual,” in accordance with 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.150(b), is an individual who has taken action that demonstrates an intent to use program
services and who meets specific program criteria for reporting, which may include the provision
of identifying information, the use of a self-service system, or receipt of information-only
services or activities. The following are considered reportable individuals for the VR program:
- •  Individuals who have applied for VR services, but have not yet met the definition of
“participant;” and
- •  Students with disabilities receiving pre-employment transition services prior to applying</p>
<p>and being determined eligible for VR services and having an approved IPE (e.g., the
student does not meet the definition of a “participant”).</p>
<p>A key difference between a “participant” and “reportable individual,” for purposes of the
common performance accountability system, is that only “participants” are included in
performance calculations for determining levels of performance for the primary indicators of</p>
<p>4</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>performance. Furthermore, there currently is no requirement for the collection and reporting of
outcome data for reportable individuals.</p>
<h2 id="internal-controls">Internal Controls</h2>
<p>As stated earlier, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.12, State VR agencies must implement
policies and procedures that ensure the proper and efficient administration of the VR program,
including those necessary to carry out all functions for which the State is responsible under this
program. These methods must include procedures to ensure accurate data collection and financial
accountability. It is incumbent on State VR agencies to establish policies and procedures that
ensure the accurate collection, retention, and timely reporting of all data. The Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards
(Uniform Guidance) (2 C.F.R. § 200.61) defines internal controls as: a process, implemented by</p>
<p>a non-Federal entity, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of
objectives in the following categories:
- •  Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
- •  Reliability of reporting for internal and external use; and
- •  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>State VR agencies must establish and maintain internal control processes necessary to ensure
the State’s ability to meet the internal control requirements. The RSA Commissioner
- (Commissioner) is responsible for the review and monitoring of State VR agencies to determine
whether a State is complying substantially with the provisions of the VR services portion of the
Unified or Combined State Plan. The reliability and validity of data reported in the RSA-911
may be subject to desk review, monitoring, and/or audits. Sections 107(b) and (c) of the Act
specify the remedies available to the Commissioner if a State fails to satisfy Federal</p>
<p>requirements governing the VR program, including requirements related to data reporting. States
that do not meet the data reporting requirements may also face potential consequences resulting
from audit findings stemming from Inspector General, State, or Single Audits.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-documentation">Supporting Documentation</h2>
<p>The requirements in 34 C.F.R. § 361.47 and 34 C.F.R. § 361.56, taken together, require State VR
agencies to maintain supporting documentation in an individual’s case file, particularly regarding
eligibility determinations, development of the IPE, services provided, and case closure. It is
important to note that the use of an electronic case management system, does not remove the
requirement for the agency to maintain either hard copies or scanned copies of required
supporting documentation in the individual’s service record. An electronic case management
system is merely a data entry process that is susceptible to data entry errors. Requiring staff to
note the source of the employment data also does not provide documentation necessary to ensure
data validity and reliability.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2018, the Departments issued joint guidance titled, “Guidance for Validating
Jointly Required Performance Data Submitted under WIOA” (RSA-TAC-19-01). This guidance
provides States with a general framework for data validation. Specifically, the Departments
developed the joint guidance pursuant to Section 116(d)(5) of WIOA, which requires the</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>Departments to establish data validation guidelines to ensure the information contained in
program reports is valid and reliable. State VR agencies must develop data validation procedures
consistent with these guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="wioa-participant-individual-record-layout-pirl">WIOA Participant Individual Record Layout (PIRL)</h2>
<p>The PIRL is derived from the Joint Performance Information Collection Request and provides a
standardized set of Data Elements, definitions, and reporting instructions that will be used to
describe the characteristics, activities, and outcomes of WIOA participants. Under the PIRL, a
“participant” for the purpose of the VR program is an individual who has an approved and signed
IPE and has begun to receive services. VR agencies are required to collect participant
information that corresponds with the Data Elements and descriptions delineated within the
PIRL. Once collected, RSA will then aggregate this information as specified in the WIOA</p>
<p>Annual Statewide Performance Report Specifications, which details the common Data Elements
and technical specifications necessary for calculation of the State and Local Area performance
report elements that will be used in reporting across all core programs. Where there is a direct
correlation between a PIRL Data Element and an RSA-911 Data Element, the PIRL Data
Element number and name have been included. There are additional PIRL Data Elements that
must be calculated from other RSA-911 Data Elements. A list of the calculated PIRL Data
Elements and the methodology used to calculate them is posted on the U.S. Department of</p>
<h2 id="labors-employment-and-training-administrations-website">Labor’s Employment and Training Administration’s website,</h2>
<p>https://www.doleta.gov/performance/reporting/.</p>
<h2 id="case-service-records">Case Service Records</h2>
<p>The case service record documents the application for and/or provision of VR and supported
employment services to individuals with disabilities, including program outcomes. An individual
may have multiple service records resulting from repeated involvement with the programs. For
example, an individual may receive pre-employment transition services and/or other VR services</p>
<p>in secondary school and then years later apply for additional VR services. These two periods of
participation in the VR program would constitute separate service records.</p>
<p>Under this data collection, State VR agencies are required to report data on open service records
on a quarterly basis. A service record is opened either when an individual applies for VR
services (Date of Application) or, in the case of a student with a disability that is solely receiving
pre-employment transition services, a date is reported for Start Date of Pre-Employment
Transition Services. These dates initiate the quarterly reporting requirement for all individuals
with an open service record.</p>
<p>The case service record is considered closed when the individual has a Date of Exit and all of the
required Data Elements, including the post-exit Data Elements, when required, have been
reported. For a student with a disability who solely received pre-employment transition services
and has not applied to receive other VR services, the service record is closed when the student is
no longer receiving such services as indicated in the pre-employment transition services Data
Elements. Duplicate individual records will not be accepted. For example, records with the same</p>
<p>Social Security Number and Date of Application would be considered a duplicate case service</p>
<p>6</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<p>record. If an individual has multiple exits within the same program year, each exit must be
reported and cannot overlap. For example, if an individual had more than one Date of
Application in a quarter, the Date of Exit associated with the first application must be a date
before the second Date of Application.</p>
<h2 id="unique-individuals">Unique Individuals</h2>
<p>All service record data submitted for the same reporting period must be associated with a unique
individual. Therefore, each individual receiving VR services must be assigned a Unique
Identifier that allows RSA to report an unduplicated count of individuals receiving services in
accordance with the WIOA PIRL. The unique identifier will also be used to calculate a count of
unique program participants for each State, which will be reported on the State Performance
Reporting Template. In addition, the unique identifier provides RSA a means to communicate</p>
<p>with agencies regarding an individual’s Data Elements without the exchange of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). RSA will use Unique Identifier and Social Security Number to
identify a unique individual within a data set. If an individual does not have a Social Security
Number (SSN) or chooses not to provide an SSN, only the Unique Identifier is reported. An
individual’s SSN is reported only once to RSA with the Unique Identifier. After that, the Unique
Identifier is the only unique individual Data Element reported with each data submission.</p>
<h2 id="edit-checks">Edit Checks</h2>
<p>RSA will periodically provide State VR agencies with comprehensive edit checks that detail, by
Data Element, the edit checks required to ensure the integrity of data submissions. Edits describe
constraints that should be satisfied by the data. Each data submission will be analyzed to
determine whether the data is consistent with the edit checks. Data submissions that fail to pass
the edit check will be returned to the VR agency for correction and resubmission. Any
corrections made must be consistent with the agency’s electronic case management system and
the supporting documentation maintained by the agency. RSA’s data editing process will</p>
<p>use both hard and soft edits. Hard edits identify records that “fail” based upon erroneous
combinations or missing values. Soft edits are constraints that identify (combinations of) values
that are suspicious but not necessarily incorrect. VR agencies are responsible for ensuring that
any data submitted conforms to edit check and data submission requirements.</p>

<p>Reserve Forces Called to Active Duty: Individual is a member of the National Guard or other reserve
04 military unit of the armed forces and is called to active duty for at least 90 days.

07 detention center) or other institution designed for confinement or rehabilitation of criminal offenders
(section 225 of WIOA).
Ineligible: The individual was found to have no disabling condition, no impediment to employment, or did
08 not require VR services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain competitive integrated
employment.
Transferred to Another Agency: Individual needs services that are more appropriately obtained
elsewhere. Transfer to another agency indicates that appropriate referral information is forwarded to the
13 other agency so that agency may provide services more effectively. Include individuals transferred to
other VR agencies.

14 (Individual exited after an IPE in competitive and integrated employment, or supported employment).
Extended Employment: Individuals who received services and were placed in a non-integrated or
15 sheltered setting for a public or private nonprofit agency or organization that provides compensation in
accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (34 CFR 361.5(c)(18)).

or email.</p>
<p>No Longer Interested in Receiving Services or Further Services: Individual actively chose not to
participate or continue in the VR program. Also use this code to indicate when an individual’s actions
18 make it impossible to begin or continue a VR program. Examples would include repeated failures to keep
appointments for assessment, counseling, or other services.</p>
<h2 id="19-all-other-reasons-this-code-is-used-for-all-other-reasons-not-included-in-other-code-values">19 All Other Reasons: This code is used for all other reasons not included in other code values.</h2>
<p>Short Term Basis Period: The individual achieved supported employment in integrated employment, but
20 did not earn a competitive wage after exhausting the short-term basis period.
Ineligible: The individual applied for VR services pursuant to section 511 of the Rehabilitation Act and
21 was determined ineligible because he or she did not wish to pursue competitive integrated employment.
Ineligible: Following Trial Work Experience(s), the individual was determined ineligible because the
22 individual was unable to benefit due to the severity of his or her disability.</p>
