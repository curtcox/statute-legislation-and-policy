<h1 id="summary-and-background">SUMMARY  AND BACKGROUND:</h1>
<p>This revised guidance rescinds and replaces TAC-20-02, published May 10, 2023, and TAC-17-</p>
<p>05, published September 11, 2017. Changes included in this guidance update the portions of
TAC-20-02 that relate to the Effectiveness in Serving Employers performance indicator to align
with the recently published ESE final rule. This revised guidance also combines all WIOA
annual state reporting requirements in one document. The remainder of this guidance remains
unchanged from TAC-20-02 and continues to outline: (1) the requirements for reaching
agreement on the negotiated levels of performance; and (2) the application of sanctions for states
outlined in section 116(f) of WIOA and its implementing joint regulations in 20 CFR part 677
and 34 CFR parts 361 and 463. 2</p>
<p>WIOA establishes performance accountability indicators and performance reporting
requirements to assess the effectiveness of states and local areas in achieving positive outcomes
for individuals served by the workforce development system’s six core programs.3</p>
<p>Under section 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA, there are six primary indicators of performance for which
each of the state core programs must negotiate levels of performance with its respective Federal
agency:</p>
<p>  Employment Rate Second Quarter after Exit (ERQ2) - The percentage of program
participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit
from the program (for the title I Youth program, the indicator is the percentage of
program participants in education or training activities, or unsubsidized employment,
during the second quarter after exit);</p>
<p>  Employment Rate Fourth Quarter after Exit (ERQ4) - The percentage of program
participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit from
the program (for the title I Youth program, the indicator is the percentage of program
participants in education or training activities, or unsubsidized employment, during the
fourth quarter after exit);</p>
<p>  Median Earnings Second Quarter after Exit (MEQ2) - The median earnings of
program participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter
after exit from the program;</p>
<h2 id="2-as-stated-in-20-cfr-677150d-and-34-cfr-361150d-and-463150d-the-negotiations-and-sanctions">2 As stated in 20 CFR § 677.150(d) and 34 CFR §§ 361.150(d) and 463.150(d), the negotiations and sanctions</h2>
<p>process only applies to states as defined in sec. 3(56) of WIOA – each of the several states of the United States, the
District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It does not apply to the outlying areas as defined in
sec. 3(45)—American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Republic of Palau.</p>

Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III and
administered by DOL (the Employment Service program); and the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program
authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV and administered by ED.

<p>  Credential Attainment Rate (CRED) - The percentage of program participants enrolled
in an education or training program (excluding those in OJT and customized training)</p>
<p>who attain a recognized postsecondary credential, or a secondary school diploma or its
recognized equivalent, during participation in or within one year after exit from the
program. Under this primary indicator, the attainment of a secondary school diploma or
its recognized equivalent is included only if the participant is employed or is enrolled in
an education or training program leading to a recognized postsecondary credential within
one year after exit from the program (this indicator does not apply to the Employment</p>
<h2 id="service-program">Service program);</h2>
<p>  Measurable Skill Gains (MSG) - The percentage of program participants who, during a
program year (PY), are in an education or training program that leads to a recognized
postsecondary credential or employment and who are achieving measurable skill gains
toward such a credential or employment (this indicator does not apply to the Employment</p>
<h2 id="service-program-and">Service program); and</h2>
<p>  Effectiveness in Serving Employers (ESE) - The percentage of program participants in
unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the program who
were employed by the same employer in the second and fourth quarters after exit. For the
six core programs, this indicator is a statewide indicator reported by one core program on
behalf of all six core programs in the state.</p>
<p>WIOA requires the Governor of each state to submit a Unified or Combined State Plan that
includes a four-year strategy for the state’s workforce development system. States are also
required to submit a modification to that plan after two years (sections 102(c) and 103(b)(1) of
WIOA). In both the initial submission of a Unified or Combined State Plan and in the required
two-year modification of the plan (section 116(b)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA)), states must include the
expected levels of performance for each primary indicator of performance for each core program,
as applicable. The approved Unified or Combined State Plan and the required two-year
modification must reflect two years of negotiated levels of performance (section
116(b)(3)(A)(iv) of WIOA). Additional information on the process for setting these levels of
performance is provided in section 4.</p>
<h2 id="negotiations-and-sanctions-guidance">NEGOTIATIONS AND SANCTIONS GUIDANCE:</h2>
<p>In this guidance, the Departments use the following terms with respect to the process of
establishing levels of performance under section 116(b) of WIOA:</p>
<p>  Expected levels of performance are the levels of performance proposed by the state in
the initial submission of the Unified or Combined State Plan and in the required two-year
modification of the Unified or Combined State Plan prior to negotiations (section
116(b)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA) for each primary indicator of performance for each core
program;</p>
<p>  Negotiated levels of performance are the levels of performance mutually agreed to by
the state and the Departments for each respective program. The negotiations process must</p>
<p>3</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<p>be based on four factors described in section 4 of this guidance. These negotiated levels
of performance must be incorporated into the approved Unified or Combined State Plan
and the approved two-year modification of that Plan (section 116(b)(3)(A)(iv) of WIOA)</p>
<p>for each primary indicator of performance for each core program;</p>
<p>  Adjusted levels of performance are levels of performance determined by adjusting the
negotiated levels of performance at the end of the program year to reflect actual
characteristics of participants served and the actual economic conditions experienced
using the statistical adjustment model (see below) (section 116(b)(3)(A)(vii) of WIOA);</p>
<p>  Actual level of performance is the outcome reported by a state on the Statewide
Performance Report (ETA-9169 OMB No. 1205-0526) for each primary indicator of
performance for each core program (section 116(d)(2) of WIOA). The Departments will
compare actual levels of performance to the adjusted levels of performance at the close of
the program year to determine the state’s performance success or failure pursuant to
section 116(b)(3)(A)(vii) of WIOA;</p>
<p>  Adjustment factor is a positive or negative difference that will be added to the
negotiated level of performance to determine the adjusted level of performance. The
adjustment factor is the difference between the estimated levels of performance predicted
by the statistical adjustment model based on pre-program year estimates of participant
characteristics and economic conditions and the levels of performance re-estimated by
the statistical adjustment model after the close of the program year based on the actual
participant characteristics and economic conditions. This calculation will yield a positive
or negative difference, which will be used as the adjustment factor for the program year;</p>
<p>  Individual indicator score is the proportion the actual level of performance represents
of the adjusted level of performance for a single performance indicator for a single
program. It is calculated by dividing the actual level of performance achieved by the
adjusted level of performance (20 CFR § 677.190(c)(5) and 34 CFR §§ 361.190(c)(5) and
463.190(c)(5));</p>
<p>  Overall state program score is the average of the individual indicator scores for a
single WIOA core program across performance indicators (20 CFR § 677.190(c)(1) and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-361190c1-and-463190c1">34 CFR §§ 361.190(c)(1) and 463.190(c)(1));</h2>
<p>  Overall state indicator score is the average of the individual indicator scores for a
single performance indicator across WIOA core programs (20 CFR § 677.190(c)(3) and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-361190c3-and-463190c3-and">34 CFR §§ 361.190(c)(3) and 463.190(c)(3)); and</h2>
<p>  Statistical adjustment model is an objective regression model, developed pursuant to
section 116(b)(3)(A)(viii) of WIOA, used to estimate levels of performance and derive
the adjusted levels of performance based on participant characteristics and economic
conditions. Economic conditions include differences in unemployment rates and job</p>
<p>losses or gains in particular industries. Characteristics of participants include but are not
limited to: indicators of poor work history, lack of work experience, lack of educational
4</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>or occupational skills attainment, dislocation from high-wage and high-benefit
employment, low levels of literacy or English proficiency, disability status,
homelessness, ex-offender status, and welfare dependency (20 CFR § 677.170(c) and 34</p>
<p>CFR §§ 361.170(c) and 463.170(c)). The statistical adjustment model also considers
other factors that, through empirical support, are determined to have an effect on state
outcomes. The Departments are committed to a transparent process for assessing state
performance. Accordingly, ETA, the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education
(OCTAE), and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) will publish the
statistical adjustment model for all primary indicators of performance on their websites.</p>
<h2 id="the-negotiations-process-overview">The Negotiations Process Overview</h2>
<h2 id="section-116b3aiv-of-wioa-requires-that-states-reach-agreement-with-the-departments-on">Section 116(b)(3)(A)(iv) of WIOA requires that states reach agreement with the Departments on</h2>
<p>levels of performance for each primary indicator of performance for each of the core programs at
two separate and distinct times, specifically during both the State Plan and State Plan
modification approval process. These agreed-upon negotiated levels of performance, commonly
known as “negotiated levels of performance,” must be included in the approved State Plan and
State Plan modification, as applicable. These negotiated levels of performance must cover the
first two program years of the Unified or Combined State Plan, with new approved negotiated</p>
<p>levels of performance for each of the primary indicators of performance for each of the core
programs covering the third and fourth years of the Unified or Combined State Plan (i.e., for the
State Plan modification approval process). The submission to the Departments of the Unified or
Combined State Plan and the required modification of a plan, including the required expected
levels of performance, initiates performance negotiations between the state and the Departments.</p>
<p>Before the start of the first program year, negotiated levels of performance for the first and
second years of the Unified or Combined State Plan must be established and included in the State
Plan for its approval. Likewise, negotiated levels of performance for the third and fourth years of
the required two-year State Plan modification must be established before the start of the third
program year. To ensure performance negotiations and State Plan submission and approval are
completed before the beginning of the first and third program years of a Unified or Combined
State Plan, states must adhere to deadlines established in separate guidance issued by the</p>
<h2 id="departments-that-govern-state-plans">Departments that govern State Plans.</h2>
<p>Attachment III “WIOA Negotiations/Performance Process Flow Chart” illustrates the process for</p>
<p>negotiations and Attachment IV “Determining Performance Success or Failure” illustrates the
process for assessing performance, which is detailed later in this guidance.</p>
<h2 id="the-negotiations-process-will-proceed-as-follows">The negotiations process will proceed as follows:</h2>
<p>  Pursuant to section 116(b)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA, each state must identify expected levels of
performance in its Unified or Combined State Plan and in the two-year modification of
that plan. Expected levels of performance for the first two years of a State Plan must be
submitted in the initial submission of the Unified or Combined State Plan and in the
initial submission of the two-year modification of that Plan, for years three and four, as
described in 20 CFR § 677.170(a) and 34 CFR §§ 361.170(a) and 463.170(a) and should</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>be the result of the state’s own analyses. Expected levels of performance must be stated to
the nearest tenth of a percent (XX.X %) or to the nearest whole dollar for median
earnings. States are reminded that the expected levels of performance proposed by states</p>
<p>in their plan must be published for public comment prior to plan submission in
accordance with state law, regulation, and policy. In order to satisfy these requirements
and deadlines, the state should not wait for the release of the latest estimated levels of
performance derived from the Departments’ statistical adjustment model.</p>
<p>  After the Unified or Combined State Plan submission, the state must negotiate and reach
agreement with the respective Federal agency on the negotiated levels of performance for
the indicators for each of the first two years of the Unified or Combined State Plan (or for
the third and fourth years of the Unified or Combined State Plan during the required two-
year modification process) for each of the core programs under section 116(b)(3)(A)(iv)
of WIOA. With respect to the ESE indicator, since it is a statewide measure that reflects a
combined result across WIOA titles I, II, III, and IV programs, the Departments will
jointly engage in negotiations with state representatives from all core programs. The
factors that will be taken into account during the negotiations process for all indicators
and scores are described in detail below under Negotiation Factors.</p>
<p>  The Departments will use the statistical adjustment model as a tool in the negotiations
process to estimate the state’s levels of performance prior to the program year to help
reach agreement on the negotiated levels of performance. The negotiation factors outlined
in section 116(b)(3)(A)(v) of WIOA and further described below under Negotiation</p>
<h2 id="factors-will-be-taken-into-account-during-this-process">Factors will be taken into account during this process.</h2>
<p>  Once negotiated levels of performance are agreed upon, the state must incorporate the
negotiated levels of performance into the Unified or Combined State Plan and the two-
year modification of that plan prior to the plan’s approval (section 116(b)(3)(A)(iv) of</p>
<h1 id="wioa">WIOA).</h1>
<p>Use of the Statistical Adjustment Model in the Negotiations and State Performance</p>
<h2 id="assessment-processes">Assessment Processes</h2>
<p>As required by section 116(b)(3)(A)(viii) of WIOA, the Departments will use the statistical
adjustment model to ensure that the impact of participant characteristics and economic conditions
in the state are accounted for in determining the negotiated levels of performance.</p>
<p>The statistical adjustment model will perform two major functions in performance negotiations
and assessment of state performance. First, it is one of the factors used when coming to
agreement on the negotiated levels of performance. It is used to account for the economic
conditions and the characteristics of participants to be served in the state and/or local areas
(section 116(b)(3)(A)(v)(II) of WIOA). Second, it will be used at the close of a program year to
adjust the negotiated levels of performance for the actual economic conditions experienced and
actual characteristics of participants served (section 116(b)(3)(A)(vii) of WIOA); these are the
adjusted levels of performance.</p>
<p>6</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<p>The Departments will update the statistical adjustment model with more recent data in a manner
that is aligned with the common framework the Departments outlined in the preamble to the</p>
<h2 id="2016-wioa-joint-final-rule4-this-approach-ensures-that-estimates-produced-before-the-program">2016 WIOA Joint Final Rule.4 This approach ensures that estimates produced before the program</h2>
<p>year begins are based on historical data and estimates produced after the program year ends are
based on actual economic conditions and participant characteristics. The addition of these data
will strengthen the statistical adjustment model’s estimates and help produce estimates that yield
accurate adjusted levels of performance and objective state performance assessments.</p>
<p>The Departments use the statistical adjustment model at two key junctures in negotiating and
assessing state performance:</p>
<p>  Before the program year, the Departments use the statistical adjustment model, based on
the data available at the time, to derive estimated coefficients and pre-program year
performance estimates. The Departments use these estimates as one of four required
factors in the negotiations process, in accordance with section 116(b)(3)(A)(v) of WIOA.</p>
<p>  After the program year, the estimated coefficients derived from the statistical adjustment</p>
<p>model are re-estimated to incorporate additional data from before the program year that
were not available at the time negotiations occurred. See Attachment V for a functional
example. These estimated coefficients are then applied to pre-program year estimates of
participant characteristics and economic conditions to obtain updated pre-program year
performance estimates. These re-estimated coefficients are also applied to the actual
economic conditions and characteristics of participants served to obtain post-program
year performance estimates. The difference between these two pre- and post-program
year performance estimates determines the adjustment factor (section 116(b)(3)(A)(vii)
of WIOA).</p>
<p>The statistical adjustment model is critically important to the WIOA performance negotiations
process. As more data become available, the Departments will periodically review the model and
refine it as necessary.</p>
<p>The Departments will assess state performance using the model containing coefficients that were
re-estimated after the program year using additional data that were not available at the time of</p>
<p>negotiations. In other words, the Departments will assess for performance using more current
data, which will lead to more accurate and reliable results than under the prior approach of using
data that were locked in at the time the negotiated levels of performance were approved. For all
core programs, the additional data used to re-estimate the coefficients include more recent
observations of economic conditions and participant characteristics up to but not including the
cohorts associated with the program year being assessed. By not including economic conditions
and participant characteristics for the program year being assessed, the Departments will
maintain separation between the state performance results being assessed and the data used to
inform the re-estimated coefficients. The Departments will analyze available data to determine if
reliable estimates can be made using the statistical adjustment model for the purpose of imposing
sanctions.</p>

<h2 id="negotiating-levels-of-performance">Negotiating Levels of Performance</h2>
<p>As discussed in more detail previously, Unified or Combined State Plan submissions and the</p>
<p>two-year modifications to those plans must contain expected levels of performance for the
primary indicators of performance (section 116(b)(3)(A)(iii) of WIOA). Submitting this
information is the first step in the negotiations process. Once the expected levels of performance
have been submitted, each core program must begin negotiations with its respective Federal
agency (section 116(b)(3)(A)(iv) of WIOA). Title I WIOA and title III Employment Service
programs will conduct these negotiations with their ETA Regional Offices. The title II AEFLA
program will conduct negotiations with OCTAE’s Division of Adult Education and Literacy, and
the title IV VR program will conduct negotiations with the RSA’s State Monitoring and Program</p>
<h2 id="improvement-division">Improvement Division.</h2>
<p>States have access to their own historical performance information and various other tools and
resources, such as data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or U.S. Census Bureau. These tools
may be used to establish the states’ expected levels of performance. When using other resources
to analyze the relationship between labor market or economic conditions and actual performance,
states should consider the reference period of the resource and the timeframes associated with
each of the primary indicators of performance and apply them accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="negotiation-factors">Negotiation Factors</h2>
<p>In reaching agreement on the negotiated levels of performance, states and the Departments must
apply the following factors pursuant to section 116(b)(3)(A)(v) of WIOA. Note that WIOA does
not specify more or less weight on any specific negotiation factor.</p>
<h2 id="1-take-into-account-how-the-levels-involved-compare-with-the-negotiated-levels-of">1. Take into account how the levels involved compare with the negotiated levels of</h2>
<p>performance established for other states (section 116(b)(3)(A)(v)(I) of WIOA).</p>
<p>The Departments will provide the most recent performance data for all states, including
previous actual, negotiated, and adjusted levels of performance, and will use this information
throughout the negotiations process.</p>
<h2 id="2-ensure-that-the-levels-involved-are-adjusted-using-an-objective-statistical-adjustment-model">2. Ensure that the levels involved are adjusted using an objective statistical adjustment model</h2>
<p>provided by the Departments (section 116(b)(3)(A)(v)(II) of WIOA).</p>
<p>Before the negotiations process begins, the Departments will provide the estimated
performance outcomes produced by the statistical adjustment model, including the
coefficients and state specific values for each variable. This information will include levels of
performance, as estimated by the Departments, to be used to inform the negotiations process.
State agencies and their respective Federal agencies must negotiate using the levels of
performance estimated by the model, as one of four factors pursuant to section
116(b)(3)(A)(v) of WIOA, for each primary indicator of performance. These estimated levels
of performance may not be altered for the purposes of negotiations, including any changes in
participant characteristics or economic conditions anticipated by the state that would result in
changes to the levels of performance predicted by the statistical adjustment model. Any</p>
<p>8</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-9">Page 9</h2>
<p>changes in participant characteristics or economic conditions will be reflected in the model

<p>The Departments consider continuous improvement to be a critical factor in the negotiations
process. The Departments will consider continuous improvement factors that ensure optimal
return on investment of Federal funds.</p>
<p>The Departments acknowledge that there are many ways to define continuous improvement</p>
<p>as related to state or national program circumstances. For example, continuous improvement
may reflect:</p>
<p> An increase from the levels of performance previously attained;
 Increases in percentile rankings of levels of performance either nationally or among
similar states;
 A change in service strategy and delivery, including more progressive or innovative
approaches designed to better meet participants’ needs;
 A change in the intensity or comprehensiveness with which individuals are served; or
 A maintenance of previous performance for the top performing states.</p>
<p>The Departments acknowledge that changes to service strategy or individuals served do not
always lead to increases in performance levels.
States and local areas must adhere to the priority of service requirements of WIOA title I</p>
<p>programs as established in WIOA.5 Additionally, the Departments encourage all other WIOA
programs to maximize service to individuals with barriers to employment who may need
more intensive services to achieve a positive outcome. The effect of serving more of these
individuals will be accounted for in the adjusted levels of performance calculated after the
program year.</p>

<h2 id="determination-of-sanctions">Determination of Sanctions</h2>
<p>There are two different types of failure that can lead to sanctions: failure to report and failure to</p>
<p>meet adjusted levels of performance (section 116(f) of WIOA). A discussion of both
circumstances is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Sanctions for Failure to Report
States must submit complete and timely WIOA annual performance reports pursuant to the</li>
</ul>
<p>WIOA Joint Final Rule at 20 CFR § 677.180(a) and 34 CFR §§ 361.180(a) and 463.180(a). The
“Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Performance Accountability, Information
and Reporting System” information collection request (WIOA Joint Performance ICR), approved
under OMB Control Number 1205-0526, contains the performance accountability reporting
requirements for the core programs.</p>
<p>Sanctions will be applied when a state fails to submit the performance reports to the appropriate
Federal agency, as required under section 116(d) of WIOA (section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA).
Consistent with 20 CFR § 677.185(a) and 34 CFR §§ 361.185(a) and 463.185(a), the
Departments consider a state as failing to submit the performance reports if the state either: (1)
does not submit performance reports by 11:59 p.m. local time on October 1 or the next business
day if October 1 falls on a holiday or weekend or (2) submits performance reports by the date for
timely submission, but the report is incomplete. 6 Annual performance reports are complete when
the state7:</p>
<p>  Attests all reports are complete and accurate to the best of its knowledge;
  Submits a WIOA Statewide Performance Report (ETA-9169) for each of the six WIOA
core programs;
  Collects and reports all required elements of the WIOA Statewide Performance Reports
as applicable to the core program and uses appropriate data for the reporting period;
  Makes available a mechanism of electronic access to local area performance reports for</p>
<h2 id="wioa-title-i-programs">WIOA title I programs;</h2>
<p>  Submits Effectiveness in Serving Employers performance results reflecting the combined
performance of all six core programs as one performance indicator; and
  Makes available a mechanism of electronic access to a complete and accurate Eligible
Training Provider (ETP) performance report for WIOA title I programs. In accordance</p>
<p>with section 116(d)(4) of WIOA and 20 CFR § 677.230(a), an ETP performance report is
complete and accurate when:</p>

<p>Workforce Integrated Performance System (WIPS) and does not intentionally subvert
the required edit checks (for example, including filler words that do not provide
meaningful program descriptions, entering $1.00 to bypass logical rules requiring
reported earnings, or repeating a placeholder value for all programs to satisfy valid
value requirements but in reality those data are missing or were not collected as
required).</p>
<p>The Department of Labor provided states with sufficient time to establish IT systems and
processes in support of required ETP reporting. The requirements for complete ETP reports
described above are efforts to improve data quality now that ETP reporting has matured, and the
All-Student waiver has expired and is no longer being granted.9 The Department of Labor
provides technical assistance resources and tools at
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/wips that include the measures of completeness
listed above (among others) so that states can proactively determine if their ETP data are
complete. Using this tool will help states to ensure that their ETA reports meet the above</p>
<p>requirements, making the report complete. Incomplete reports may be subject to sanctions
pursuant to 20 CFR § 677.185(a). Should these thresholds for complete reporting need to be
adjusted, this guidance will be revised as necessary.</p>
<p>If the performance reports submitted by the state do not meet all of the above requirements by
the reporting deadline, the state annual report is incomplete.</p>

exceptional circumstances outside the state’s control as determined by the Departments. The
Departments defined “exceptional circumstances” in 20 CFR § 677.185(b) and 34 CFR §§

<h2 id="extension-requests">Extension Requests</h2>
<p>In the event of exceptional circumstances as described in the preceding section, the state must</p>
<p>notify the Secretary of Labor or Education, as appropriate, in writing of a potential impact on the
state’s ability to submit its annual performance report, and request an extension, in order not to
be considered failing to report (20 CFR § 677.185(c) and 34 CFR §§ 361.185(c) and 463.185(c)).
The state’s request for an extension should include a detailed account identifying the unexpected
events precluding timely reporting sufficient for the Departments to make a determination. The
following information should be included in an extension request:</p>
<p>  Sufficient detail of the unexpected circumstances that will lead to untimely or incomplete
reporting to warrant an extension;
  A proposed extension, fitting of the circumstances causing the delay, which should not
exceed 30 calendar days after the established annual reporting deadline;
  The names and contact information of each responsible state designee or designated point
of contact who will ensure that any extended deadline will be met; and</p>
<p>  Any other information that the state deems relevant to help explain the need for an
extension.</p>
<p>The state must submit the extension request as soon as possible, but not later than 30 calendar
days prior to the established annual reporting deadline (20 CFR § 677.185(c)(1) and 34 CFR §§
361.185(c)(1) and 463.185(c)(1)). The annual reporting deadline is October 1 each year or the
next business day if October 1 falls on a holiday or weekend. Therefore, states must submit
reporting extension requests no later than September 1 (or the next business day if September 1
falls on a holiday or weekend).</p>
<p>In cases where unexpected, exceptional circumstances occur within 30 calendar days of the
established annual reporting deadline, the state must submit an extension request to the Secretary
of Labor or Education, as applicable, as soon as possible but not later than the established annual
reporting deadline (20 CFR § 677.185(c)(2) and 34 CFR §§ 361.185(c)(2) and 463.185(c)(2)).
Under these circumstances, in addition to the information described above, the request should</p>
<p>include sufficient explanation as to why notification of the delay could not be provided 30
calendar days prior to the established annual reporting deadline.</p>
<p>All extension requests will be reviewed by the Departments for completeness and a thorough
explanation of exceptional circumstances. The Departments may grant extension requests as
submitted, grant extension requests with revisions, or reject the extension requests. Proposed
reporting extensions should not exceed 30 calendar days after the established annual reporting
deadline and should be appropriate to and commensurate with the exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>In the event of failure to report timely or completely, pursuant to section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA,
the Governor’s discretionary funds provided under section 128(a) of WIOA will be reduced by
five percent of the maximum available allotment in the immediately succeeding program year.
The WIOA Joint Final Rule at 20 CFR § 677.195(a) and 34 CFR §§ 361.195(a) and 463.195(a)
provide that the sanction is equal to five percent of the maximum allotment percentage that could
be reserved by the Governor in the succeeding program year, not a five percentage-point</p>
<p>12</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-13">Page 13</h2>
<p>reduction from the amount that a Governor elected to reserve. This sanction will be enforced for
each year in which a state fails to report timely or completely.</p>
<ul>
<li>b. Sanctions for Failure to Meet Adjusted Levels of Performance
In accordance with 20 CFR § 677.190(d) and 34 CFR §§ 361.190(d) and 463.190(d), a
performance failure occurs if:</li>
</ul>
<p>  Any single Individual Indicator Score for any single core program falls below 50 percent
of the adjusted level of performance;
  The Overall State Program Score falls below 90 percent for that single core program; or
  The Overall State Indicator Score falls below 90 percent for that single measure.</p>
<p>Any state that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of
performance for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the
development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or
Secretary of Education (20 CFR § 677.190(b) and 34 CFR §§ 361.190(b) and 463.190(b)).
However, if the state has the same performance failure occur in two consecutive program years,
the Departments will apply sanctions. Further explanation of how technical assistance and
sanctions will be applied is provided later in this section. A description of how this applies to
assessing the ESE performance indicator can be found in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="determining-performance-success-or-failure">Determining Performance Success or Failure</h2>
<p>The Departments will determine state performance success or failure at the end of each program
year. In order to make a determination of success or failure, the negotiated levels of performance
for that year will be adjusted using the statistical adjustment model, which will factor in data on
the actual economic conditions of the state and the actual characteristics of the populations
served by the program during that year. This adjustment will be calculated using the adjustment
factor to produce the adjusted levels of performance described in the “Terms” section above. A
detailed explanation of this calculation is found in Attachment II “Calculation—Adjusted Level
of Performance.” This will determine the adjusted levels of performance for the program year
against which the state’s actual levels of performance will be evaluated through the calculation
of the performance score. Attachment IV, “Determining Performance Success or Failure,”
provides an overview of the entire process.</p>
<p>The individual indicator score is calculated by dividing the actual level of performance achieved
by the adjusted level of performance. The adjusted level of performance is calculated by adding</p>
<p>the adjustment factor to the negotiated level of performance. The individual indicator score will
not be rounded; it will be truncated to the first decimal place. A detailed example can be found in</p>
<h2 id="attachment-i">Attachment I.</h2>
<p>Table 1 illustrates an example calculation of the Overall State Program Scores. An Overall State
Program Score is derived for each WIOA core program reflecting all applicable primary
indicators of performance. Because ESE is reported on a statewide basis, it is not included in the
calculation. The performance scores are calculated for each applicable primary indicator of
performance and the average is computed. In this example, the Individual Indicator Score for
13</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-14">Page 14</h2>
<p>Employment Rate—4th Quarter after Exit of 46.8 percent is a performance failure because it is
below the 50.0 percent threshold.</p>
<p>The Overall State Program Score of 81.5 percent is obtained by averaging the scores for each
applicable indicator in the program. Again, the ESE indicator is not included in this calculation
because it is reported on a statewide basis. In this example, the core program did not achieve 90
percent, which is considered a performance failure. Percentages will not be rounded in this
calculation; they will be truncated to the tenth of a percent.</p>

Table 2 illustrates an example calculation of the Overall State Indicator Scores. An Overall State
Indicator Score is derived for each primary indicator of performance across all WIOA core
programs, other than ESE, which is reported on a statewide basis. In this example, the
performance scores are calculated for the Employment—2nd Quarter after Exit indicator for each
core program, and the average is computed. In this case, the Overall State Indicator Score, which
is the average of all Individual Indicator Scores, is 92.6 percent, meaning that the core program
achieved performance success. Again, percentages will not be rounded in this calculation; they
will be truncated to the tenth of a percent.

(c)(3)(ii), the Overall State Indicator Score for ESE, as reported by one core program on behalf
of all six core programs in the state, is a statewide indicator that reflects the performance for all

<p>The Departments used their transition authority under section 503(a) of WIOA to implement a
phased-in approach to determine performance success or failure for each indicator or program,
due to lack of available data, consistent with the requirements of 20 CFR § 677.190(c) and 34
CFR §§ 361.190(c) and 463.190(c). Consistent with past practice, the Departments will continue
to inform states when the assessment of any performance indicator is delayed.11</p>

<p>The ESE indicator has been defined in the ESE final rule and PY 2024 will be the first year of
data for the newly defined performance indicator. However a minimum of at least two baseline
years of data must be collected to support a statistical adjustment model that could produce</p>
<p>sufficiently reliable estimates for the purposes of performance negotiations and state
performance assessments.12 The Departments, in accordance with 20 CFR § 677.190(c)(4) and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-361190c4-and-463190c4-will-collect-and-monitor-state-ese-performance">34 CFR §§ 361.190(c)(4) and 463.190(c)(4), will collect and monitor state ESE performance</h2>
<p>results for at least PY 2024 and PY 2025 to establish a credible baseline and provide technical
assistance. After PY 2025 data are collected the Departments will develop a statistical
adjustment model for ESE in accordance with section 116(b)(3)(A)(viii) of WIOA. The
Departments will notify the states of the model estimates’ reliability and the Departments’ ability
to use the model for the purposes of fair and objective state performance assessments.</p>
<p>If a performance failure occurs at the end of the program year, the respective Federal agency and
the state agency will work to develop a performance improvement plan, and the Federal agency
will provide technical assistance in accordance with section 116(f)(1)(A) of WIOA.</p>
<p>In this guidance, the Departments want to make clear that if the state has the same performance
failure occur in two consecutive program years, the Departments will apply sanctions, pursuant
to section 116(f)(1)(B) of WIOA. This applies regardless of where those program years fall</p>
<p>within the negotiations cycle. That is, although state negotiated levels of performance are
negotiated at two-year intervals, a failure in the second year of one negotiation cycle followed by
the same failure in the first year of the subsequent negotiation cycle is considered a failure in two
consecutive program years. For example, the Departments will establish negotiated levels of
performance for PYs 2024 and 2025 in one negotiation cycle and negotiated levels of
performance for PYs 2026 and 2027 in another negotiation cycle. A state will be sanctioned if it
has a repeat performance failure in PYs 2025 and 2026.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Departments will reduce the Governor’s discretionary funds provided under
section 128(a) of WIOA by five percent of the maximum available amount in the program year
immediately succeeding the second consecutive performance failure. This sanction will be
enforced each successive year in which the state continues to have the same performance failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>c. Sanctions for Failure to Report and Repeat Failure to Meet Adjusted Levels of</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-in-the-same-program-year">Performance in the Same Program Year</h2>
<p>If the state, in the same year, has both types of failure that would result in sanctions being
applied as described in sections (a) and (b) above, meaning the state has both a failure to report
and a failure to meet adjusted levels of performance for a second consecutive program year, then
the Departments will apply sanctions for both types of failure. The WIOA Joint Final Rule at 20
CFR § 677.195(b) and 34 CFR §§ 361.195(b) and 463.195 provide that the sanction is equal to
ten percent of the maximum allotment percentage that could be reserved by the Governor in the
succeeding program year. The Departments will enforce this sanction each successive year in
which the state continues to have the same reporting and performance failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>a. Negotiations with Local Areas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-116c1ai-of-wioa-requires-that-all-of-the-primary-indicators-of-performance">Section 116(c)(1)(A)(i) of WIOA requires that all of the primary indicators of performance,</h2>
<p>including the ESE indicator, must be applied at the local level for the WIOA title I programs
(Adult, Dislocated Worker, and Youth). Furthermore, 20 CFR § 677.205(a) provides that “[e]ach
local area in a state under WIOA title I is subject to the same primary indicators of performance
for the core programs for WIOA title I under 20 CFR § 677.155(a)(1) and (c) that apply to the
state.”</p>
<ul>
<li>i. Local Performance and Negotiations for the ESE Indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>The same methods described in the Negotiating Levels of Performance and Determining
Performance Success or Failure sections of this guidance, for defining performance levels and
assessing performance at the state level, also apply at the local level. For ESE, this means that
states and local areas must agree to a single, shared level of performance for the WIOA Adult,
Dislocated Worker, and Youth programs in the local area. This single, shared level will be used
to assess the one shared ESE result for all WIOA title I programs in the local area. For all other</p>
<p>primary indicators of performance, each WIOA title I program will have individual negotiated
levels of performance and will be assessed as individual programs.</p>
<p>The state is required to negotiate the ESE indicator with all local areas in program years in which
this measure is also negotiated between the state and DOL. For PYs 2024 and 2025, baseline
data will be reported by states. This means that states should be collecting baseline data for these
two years from their local areas to incorporate in the state’s future local area statistical
adjustment model as well.</p>
<p>ii. Criteria for Complete Local Area Negotiations</p>
<p>In accordance with 20 CFR § 677.210(c), states must incorporate the following criteria into the
negotiations dialogue with each local area:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-local-board-the-chief-elected-official-and-the-governor-must-negotiate-and-reach">1. The local board, the Chief Elected Official, and the Governor must negotiate and reach</h2>
<p>agreement on local levels of performance based on each local area’s historical
performance results and service capacity levels, and how each individual local area
assists in/contributes to the aggregate attainment of the state negotiated levels of</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<h2 id="2-in-negotiating-the-local-levels-of-performance-the-local-board-the-chief-elected-official">2. In negotiating the local levels of performance, the local board, the Chief Elected Official,</h2>
<p>and the Governor also must use the above-listed four factors of negotiation used at the
state level.</p>
<h2 id="3-in-addition-the-states-statistical-adjustment-model-that-aligns-with-the-framework-of-the">3. In addition, the state’s statistical adjustment model that aligns with the framework of the</h2>
<p>state-level model must be used at the beginning of the program year to negotiate and at
the end of the program year to adjust negotiated local levels of performance in order to
reflect the actual economic conditions experienced in the local area and the
characteristics of the actual individuals served according to the state’s established
policies.
17</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-18">Page 18</h2>
<p>This means the negotiated levels of performance for a given local area will differentiate from the
negotiated levels of the other local areas and the state for each program and performance
indicator based on the characteristics of participants served, past performance, economic</p>
<p>conditions of the local area, and the other required factors of negotiations listed above.</p>
<p>States should make available to the state’s DOL-ETA Regional Office these negotiated and
adjusted levels when completed, as well as making available the established policies for local
performance negotiations and assessment, to the local boards and the state’s DOL-ETA Regional
Office prior to the start of the program year in which the policies will be applied.</p>
<p>The Departments have developed the framework for an objective statistical adjustment model
that satisfies the WIOA requirements at the state level. States must use this framework and
develop a model that satisfies their needs at the local level, both in the performance negotiations
and year-end adjustment of local levels of performance.</p>
<p>The local board, the Chief Elected Official, and the Governor must negotiate and reach
agreement on local levels of performance for two program years at a time, based on the state’s
negotiated levels of performance, no later than September 30 in each year in which state
negotiations occur. The state must notify its DOL-ETA Regional Office that negotiations are</p>
<p>complete and include in the notification the agreed-upon levels of performance for each local
area.</p>
<ul>
<li>b. Local Performance Success and Failure</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="states-must-use-local-performance-goals-for-wioa-title-i-programs-for-two-required-purposes">States must use local performance goals for WIOA title I programs for two required purposes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>(1) to determine if a local area “performed successfully” for subsequent local area designation,
and (2) to determine when a state must take corrective action when a local area fails to meet the
adjusted levels of performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of determining subsequent local area designation, the term “performed
successfully” means that the local area met or exceeded the levels of performance the Governor
negotiated with the local board and chief elected official for WIOA primary indicators of
performance and that the local area has not failed any individual measure for the last two
consecutive program years in accordance with a state-established definition, provided in the
Unified or Combined State Plan, of “met or exceeded performance.” For subsequent designation</p>
<p>determinations made at the conclusion of PY 2018, or at any point thereafter, states must base
their findings of whether a local area performed successfully for the two most recently completed
program years on all six of the WIOA primary indicators of performance where at least two
years of negotiated and adjusted performance levels are available.</p>
<p>Before coming to agreement on the negotiated levels of performance for the local area, a state
must establish the threshold for failure to meet adjusted levels of performance for a local area
Following the conclusion of the program year, a state must establish the adjusted level of
performance for a local area, using the statistical adjustment model described. At least two years
of complete data on any indicator for any local core program are required in order to establish
adjusted levels of performance for a local area. States must provide technical assistance if a local</p>
<p>18</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-19">Page 19</h2>
<p>area fails to meet the adjusted levels of performance agreed to for the primary indicators of
performance in WIOA title I programs in any program year. Upon the state’s request to the
Secretary of Labor, DOL may provide this technical assistance. The technical assistance may</p>
<p>include:</p>
<p>  Assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan;
  The development of a modified local or regional plan; or
  Other actions designed to assist the local area in improving performance.</p>
<p>If a local area fails to meet the adjusted levels of performance agreed to for the same primary
indicators of performance for the same core program authorized under WIOA title I for a third
consecutive program year, the Governor must take corrective actions. If the Governor takes
corrective action against a local area for failing to meet the negotiated goals, the state workforce
agency should advise its Federal Project Officer of this action. The corrective actions must
include the development of a reorganization plan under which the Governor:</p>
<p>  Requires the appointment and certification of a new local board, consistent with the
criteria in 20 CFR § 679.350;
  Prohibits the use of eligible providers and one-stop partners that have been identified as
achieving poor levels of performance; or
  Takes such other significant actions as the Governor determines are appropriate, which
may include local area redesignation without the support of the local area in accordance
with section 116(g)(2)(A) of WIOA and 20 CFR § 677.220(b).</p>

<p>States and Federal agencies negotiate to one decimal place. Actual levels of performance are
calculated by dividing the number of successes within an indicator (numerator) by the total
number of participants matching the qualifications for the given indicator (denominator). Actual
levels of performance are reported by the state for all primary indicators of performance. In the
WIOA statewide performance report (ETA-9169), actual levels of performance are represented
by rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent, but for the purpose of performing these
calculations, actual levels of performance and adjusted levels of performance are neither rounded
nor truncated.</p>

<p>After the Indicator Score is calculated for each single primary indicator of performance, it is
populated into the below matrix. Each row of Indicator Scores is averaged and truncated to one
decimal place to produce the Overall State Indicator Score. In the example below, the average of
the Employment Rate—2nd Quarter after Exit Indicator Scores for the six programs is 0.89985
and is truncated to one decimal place for an Overall State Indicator Score of 89.9%. Note that
because the ESE indicator is a single shared statewide indicator, there is no need to calculate an
average of the individual program results. Instead, the shared statewide ESE result will be
divided by the adjusted level of performance for ESE to determine performance success or
failure.</p>

<h2 id="calculationadjusted-level-of-performance">Calculation—Adjusted Level of Performance</h2>
<p>The Federal agencies estimate levels of performance based on participant characteristics and
economic conditions using an objective statistical model. The pre-program year performance
estimate is provided to states prior to the start of the program year during the negotiations
process and is a factor in reaching agreement on the negotiated levels of performance. After the
close of the program year, the Federal agencies will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) re-estimate the coefficients in the statistical adjustment model with the additional year(s)
of data available;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) apply the revised coefficients to the same pre-program year participant characteristics and
economic conditions used in calculating the estimated levels of performance to generate
the pre-program year estimate (Estimate ); and
0</p>
</li>
<li>(3) apply the revised coefficients to the characteristics of the actual participants served and
the actual economic conditions of the state to estimate the state’s actual program year
performance (Estimate ).
1
Federal agencies will subtract Estimate from Estimate to obtain the adjustment factor. The
0          1
resulting positive or negative adjustment factor is added to the negotiated level of performance to
arrive at the adjusted level of performance. These calculations are shown in Examples 1 and 2
below. Refer to section on Determining Performance Success or Failure of the guidance for an
explanation of how the adjusted level of performance is used to determine performance success
or failure.</li>

<p>Functional Example of the Approach for Using the Statistical Adjustment Model</p>
<p>The Departments will use the most current data available to derive adjusted levels of
performance for all six core programs, thereby furthering a consistent application of the common
framework. The example below demonstrates how and when the Departments will add more
current data to the statistical adjustment model to produce more accurate results. After the first
program year, the Departments will add an additional year of data to the statistical adjustment
model. After the second program year, the Departments will add a second additional year of data.</p>
<p>This example reflects a hypothetical economic upturn that occurred after RSA and a state VR
program established negotiated levels of performance before the program years began.</p>
<h2 id="before-pys-2024-and-2025-begin">Before PYs 2024 and 2025 begin:</h2>
<p> In its State Plan, a state VR program submits expected levels of performance of 46.0% for PY
2024 and 47.0% for PY 2025 for the measurable skill gains indicator.</p>
<p> The statistical adjustment model produces a pre-program year estimate of 45.0% for PYs
2024 and 2025. This estimate is based on data from PYs 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Because the negotiations take place during PY 2023, economic conditions and participant
data for PY 2023 are not yet available. PY 2022 data are the most recent data available at that
time.</p>
<p> Using the pre-program year estimateand other negotiation factors, RSA and the state VR
program agree to negotiated levels of performance of 47.0% for PY 2024 and 48.0% for PY
2025.</p>
<h2 id="after-py-2024-ends">After PY 2024 ends:</h2>
<p> The state VR program reports an actual level of performance of 52.0% for PY 2024.</p>
<p> RSA produces Estimate of 50.0% that includes PY 2023 data in addition to data available at
0
the time of negotiations which, at the time of the assessment, are the most recent data
available to the Departments.
 Using PY 2023 data, the statistical adjustment model produces an Estimate of 52.0% for PY

<p>conditions in PY 2024.
 RSA calculates an adjustment factor of 2.0% (52.0% - 50.0%).</p>
<p> RSA adds 2.0% to the negotiated level of performance of 47.0% to produce an adjusted level
of performance of 49.0%.</p>
<p> RSA divides the actual level of performance of 52.0% by the adjusted level of performance
of 49.0% to produce an individual indicator score of 106.0%, which means the state VR</p>

<p> The state VR program reports an actual level of performance of 52.0% for PY 2025.</p>
<p> The statistical adjustment model produces Estimate for PY 2025 of 53.0% using PYs 2023

and 2024 data in addition to data available at the time of negotiations. Of note, this is another
PY’s worth of data being added to the statistical adjustment model to ensure it incorporates
the most recent economic conditions and participant data available to the Departments at the
time the calculations are being done.
 Using PYs 2023 and 2024, the statistical adjustment model produces an Estimate of 59.0%
1
for PY 2025. This estimate is based on the actual participant characteristics and actual
economic conditions in PY 2025.</p>
<p> RSA calculates an adjustment factor of 6.0% (59.0% - 53.0%).
 RSA adds 6.0% to the negotiated level of performance of 48.0% to produce an adjusted level
of performance of 54.0%.</p>
<p>RSA divides the actual level of performance of 52.0% by the adjusted level of performance of
54.0% to produce an individual indicator score of 96.0%, which means the state VR program
passed this performance indicator for PY 2025 pursuant to 34 CFR § 361.190(d)(1) and (2) since
the individual indicator score was greater than 50 percent.</p>
