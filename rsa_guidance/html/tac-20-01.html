<p>To provide an update on technical assistance to states, territories, and outlying areas related to
the requirements for submitting PYs 2020-2023 Unified and Combined State Plans under
sections 102 and 103 of WIOA1. The PYs 2020-2023 Unified and Combined State Plans will

<h1 id="action-requested">ACTION REQUESTED:</h1>
<p>As described in an email to States on November 6, 2019, to encourage implementation and
integration of workforce development services, WIOA requires States2 to submit a four-year
Unified or Combined State Plan that covers, at a minimum, the six core programs of the</p>
<p>workforce development system. In order to satisfy the submission requirements of sections
102(c)(1)(B) and 103(b)(1) of WIOA for these State Plans, each State’s Governor must submit a
Unified or Combined State Plan for the four-year period covering PYs 2020-2023 by March 2,</p>

<p>unless the Secretaries of Labor and Education inform the State in writing within that time period
that the Plan is inconsistent with the State Plan requirements or the provisions authorizing the
core programs, as appropriate (sections 102(c)(2)(B) and 103(c)(3)(A) of WIOA).</p>
<p>While WIOA imposes no statutory penalties for submissions after March 2, 2020, for those
States submitting Unified or Combined State Plans for the core programs after April 1, 2020, the
Secretaries of Labor and Education, as well as the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services</p>
<p>Administration, will do their best to approve the Unified or Combined State Plans prior to July 1,
2020, which is the start of PY 2020. However, because Plans submitted after April 1, 2020, will
not give the Secretaries the full 90 days allowed by law to review and approve the Plans, the
awarding of core program funds for those States could be delayed.4</p>
<h2 id="section-103a1-of-wioa-permits-states-to-submit-a-combined-state-plan-that-includes-the-six">Section 103(a)(1) of WIOA permits States to submit a Combined State Plan that includes the six</h2>
<p>core programs and one or more programs identified in section 103(a)(2). At least two of those
partner programs — the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, as
amended by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act for the 21st Century Act
(Perkins V), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training
(SNAP E&amp;T) — were recently reauthorized. The U.S. Departments of Labor (DOL) and
Education (ED) (collectively, Departments) encourage the inclusion of Perkins V and SNAP
E&amp;T in strategic planning, and are available to provide technical assistance on plan submission
and timing to ease inclusion. Under these circumstances, States should contact the appropriate
Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Regional Office and federal program contact in
writing to discuss the timing of state submission and the potential core program funding</p>
<p>implications for plans that may not be approved until after the commencement of PY 2020.</p>
<p>States are expected to submit Plans via the State Plan Portal described in Section 4e of this
technical assistance.</p>
<h1 id="summary-and-background">SUMMARY  AND BACKGROUND:</h1>
<p>Summary: This updated technical assistance – developed jointly by DOL, ED, the U.S.
Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA), and Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) – provides information and instructions to states on the WIOA
planning requirements for the required four-year state plan, explains technical adjustments to the
planning requirements, and instructs states regarding submission deadlines and procedures,
particularly with respect to the newly developed State Plan Portal. The technical assistance is
similar to that which the Departments provided prior to the submission of the PYs 2016-2019</p>

<p>Background: WIOA requires the Governor of each state to submit a Unified or Combined State</p>
<p>Plan that includes a four-year strategy and operational plan for the continuing implementation of
the state’s workforce development system. States must have federally approved state plans to
receive funding under the six core programs (Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, AEFLA,
Wagner-Peyser, and the VR programs). The Office of Management and Budget approved the
joint WIOA State Plan information collection request (ICR) on September 5, 2019 (OMB No.
1205-0522)5. Subsequently, OMB approved changes to the ICR to implement the Wagner-Peyser</p>
<h2 id="act-staffing-flexibility-final-rule-released-on-january-6-2020">Act Staffing Flexibility final rule, released on January 6, 2020.</h2>
<p>Under WIOA, the Unified and Combined State Plans communicate the state’s vision for the state
workforce system and serve as a vehicle for alignment and integration across federal programs.
WIOA planning requirements aim to foster better alignment of federal investments in job
training and education, to integrate service delivery across programs, to improve efficiency in
service delivery, and to ensure that the workforce system matches job creators with skilled
individuals. Cross-program planning promotes a shared understanding of the workforce needs
within each state. Such planning cultivates development of more comprehensive and integrated
approaches, such as career pathways and sector strategies, for addressing the needs of job</p>
<p>creators and workers. Additionally, it enables the system to provide a wider range of
coordinated and streamlined services to their shared customers.</p>
<h2 id="planning-requirements-and-submission-instructions">PLANNING REQUIREMENTS AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a. Plan Options. States must submit, at minimum, a Unified State Plan encompassing the six
WIOA core programs (See Section 102 of WIOA). Alternatively, states may submit a
Combined State Plan that includes the six core programs plus one or more of the partner
programs listed below. States that developed and implemented a Unified State Plan for PYs
2016-2019 may elect to submit a Combined State Plan for the next four-year planning period,
drawing on the improved alignment and coordination with partner programs during the past
few years. The Combined State Plan partner programs are:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>b. WIOA Planning Priorities. States have accumulated four years of WIOA implementation
experience since the first WIOA State Plans were developed, and as such, have worked
through challenges to find what works best for their state’s workforce development system.
As states think about goals and specific implementation milestones for the next four years of
WIOA, the Departments request that planning advance some or all of these key priorities:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• Engaging partners to align workforce investment, economic development, and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>education systems, particularly with community colleges, to maximize services to
customers and eliminate redundant services;
- • Investing in workforce development strategies grounded in sound economic and labor
market analysis with program and other funds, consistent with authorizing statutes;
- • Promoting opportunity for economic mobility, especially by implementing human
services programs to increase work participation;
- • Using flexibility within WIOA to better serve those most in need by advancing the
use of evidence-based strategies such as apprenticeship, work-based learning,
customized training, and the full array of employment and training options;
- • Providing multiple career pathways, skill-building, and stackable credential
opportunities for labor market entry and advancement to both youth participants and
new labor force participants;</p>
<ul>
<li>• Informing job-seekers and learners of the skills, credentials, and jobs in demand;</li>
<li>• Increasing the competitiveness of employers through the provision of quality labor
market information, sector-based approaches, and a well-trained talent pipeline; and
4</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Measuring effectiveness through performance reporting, evaluation, and data systems
that support these activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c. State Plan Information Collection Request (ICR) and Technical Changes to Requirements.
States must use the ICR Required Elements for Submission of the Unified or Combined State
Plan and Plan Modifications Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>approved under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1205-0522, to
develop and submit the four-year State Plan. A copy of the ICR, which complies with
Sections 102 and 103 of WIOA, is available on ETA’s website at
https://www.doleta.gov/wioa/docs/State-Plan-ICR.pdf.</p>
<p>OMB  approved a three-year ICR extension through September 30, 2022, that includes a
small number of changes to the requirements. These changes include removal of references
to past dates, correction of typographical errors, introduction of an optional data element to
provide an executive summary, updating title II Section 243 narrative and assurance
requirements, and updating instructions for Appendix I of the ICR. The Wagner-Peyser Act
Staffing Flexibility final rule, published on January 6, 2020 and effective beginning February
5, 2020, makes additional changes to the requirements, specifically to requirements regarding
staffing for Wagner-Peyser Act programs.</p>
<p>The ICR contains both strategic and operational elements that support integration and
alignment of the workforce system. The Strategic and Operational Planning Elements</p>
<p>constitute the “common elements” of the Plan – elements that apply to all programs that
states include in their plan. The Strategic Elements must include an analysis of the state’s
current economic environment and identification of the state’s overall vision for its
workforce development system, including an analysis of the economy and workforce
development activities (See Section 102(b)(1) of WIOA). The Operational Elements must
identify the state’s planned actions to implement the state’s strategic vision and goals
identified in the Strategic Elements. This section requires description of the policy,
infrastructure, and program integration and alignment activities the state will undertake, as
well as planning elements specific to each of the core programs and any required one-stop
partner programs (See Section 102(b)(2) of WIOA).</p>
<ul>
<li>d. Stakeholder Collaboration and Comment. Stakeholder collaboration, review, and comment
are key requirements of the four-year planning process. In accordance with section 101 of
WIOA, State Workforce Development Boards (State Boards) must assist the Governor in the
development, implementation, and modification of the State Plan, and ensure that all relevant
core programs, required partners, and stakeholders contribute to the plan. The Departments
encourage inclusion of the state labor market information and evaluation offices (or their</li>
</ul>
<p>equivalent) during plan development to obtain assistance with labor market data, evidence,
and analysis. The State Plan must be developed with the assistance of the State Board, as
required by Section 101(d) of WIOA, and in coordination with administrators that have
optimal policymaking authority for the core programs and required one-stop partner
programs. For Combined State Plans, the portions of the plan that cover partner programs</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>other than the core programs are subject to any public comment requirements applicable to
those partner programs.6</p>
<p>States must provide the opportunity for public comment and input, which allows interested
stakeholders to participate actively, effectively, and transparently in the development of the
plan. The Governor must ensure that the State Plan is developed with an opportunity for
input from representatives of:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Local Workforce Development Boards and chief elected officials;</li>
<li>• businesses;</li>
<li>• representatives of labor organizations;</li>
<li>• community-based organizations;</li>
<li>• adult education providers;</li>
<li>• institutions of higher education;</li>
<li>
<p>• other stakeholders with an interest in the services provided by the six core programs;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• the general public, including individuals with disabilities.7</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The State Board also must make information regarding the State Plan and planning process
available to the public through electronic means and by holding regularly-occurring open
meetings in accordance with state law prior to the submission of the plan.8</p>
<ul>
<li>e. Instructions for Plan Submission Using the WIOA State Plan Portal. States must submit
their state plans via the State Plan Portal (https://wioaplans.ed.gov), which has been
developed for the purpose of cross-program collaboration in states and to facilitate the
simultaneous receipt and review of plans across multiple federal agencies. The State Plan
Portal has been redesigned to improve the user experience. While multiple individuals in
states may enter content into the portal, only one individual from the state may submit to the
Departments the entire plan on behalf of all included programs. The State Plan Portal
includes a certification that the official state “submitter” has the authority to do so on behalf
of the Governor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Departments will provide in separate communications details regarding designation of
plan submitters, obtaining user accounts, requesting permission levels, and user training.
Previously approved WIOA State Plans will be available in PDF format in the State Plan
Portal; however, content from prior plans will not be available in the data entry fields. After
approved plans are in place for PY 2020-2023, the portal will remain available to state users
for submission of off-cycle modifications.</p>

<ul>
<li>f. Considerations for Combined State Plan partner programs. Combined State Plan partner
programs’ state plan requirements will continue to exist under specific ICRs for those
programs. Note that some of the other programs that a state may include in the Combined
State Plan currently fulfill their program-specific state planning requirements through a
separate information collection process maintained by the federal government agency that
administers the Combined State Plan partner program. For example, Section 103(b)(2) of
WIOA specifically allows a state to include the employment and training activities, rather</li>
</ul>
<p>than the full program carried out under the CSBG Act administered by HHS and employment
and training activities funded by HUD in a WIOA Combined State Plan. Therefore, if states
choose to include programs such as these in the Combined State Plan, only the portion of the
existing planning requirements that address the employment and training activities may be
included in the Combined State Plan. States still must submit all other required elements of a
complete State Plan for those programs directly to the Department that administers the
program.</p>
<p>Portions of the Combined State Plan covering a program or activity, excluding those related
to the core programs, are subject to approval by the head of the federal agency that
administers that program.9 The portions of the Combined State Plan related to the core
programs are subject to the same approval requirements applicable to the Unified State</p>
<h2 id="plan10">Plan.10</h2>
<p>States that include UI in their Combined State Plan, carried out under Title III, Section 302,
of the Social Security Act, including Sections 303(a)(8) and (9), which govern the</p>
<p>expenditure of funds, should submit their UI State Quality Service Plan (SQSP) following the
cycle as outlined in the current Employment &amp; Training Handbook No. 336, UI SQSP</p>
<h2 id="planning-and-reporting-guidelines">Planning and Reporting Guidelines.</h2>
<p>The Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program, carried out under Chapter 41 of Title 38
of the U.S. Code, require both a JVSG State Plan and a separate annual application for
funding. States may include the JVSG Plan in a Combined WIOA State Plan. For JVSG, the
annual application for funding will continue to be required by current Veterans’ Employment
and Training Service (VETS) guidance.</p>
<p>For DOL or ED-administered programs in a Combined State Plan, the portions of the plan
covering the core programs, and the common elements for all programs included in the State
Plan, will be approved ninety (90) days after submission unless the Secretary of either
Department informs the state in writing during the 90-day period that the plan is inconsistent
with WIOA's State Plan requirements or the requirements authorizing the core program.
HUD, USDA, and HHS must approve or disapprove the portions of the plan covering
programs administered by those Departments within 120 days of submission. For the six</p>
<p>core programs, DOL and ED may make decisions regarding approval, disapproval, or</p>
<h2 id="9-see-wioa-section-103c1-and-d2">9 See WIOA Section 103(c)(1) and (d)(2).</h2>

<hr />
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<p>funding status separately from the determination of approval, disapproval, or completeness of
the program-specific requirements of Combined State Plan partner programs and activities
described in the Combined State Plan. For example, if a State Plan meets all the common
planning elements and program specific requirements for the core programs, approval and
funding may proceed regardless of specific issues that may be identified in the program-
specific sections for any Combined State Plan partner programs.</p>
<p>States that include Perkins V as part of their Combined State Plans will submit the narrative
descriptions required for the Perkins V program-specific portion of their Combined State
Plan as outlined in the Perkins V State Plan Guide, OMB Control Number 1830-0029, to the
State Plan Portal for WIOA. States will then submit to the Perkins State Plan Portal the
remaining items required for the Perkins V program-specific portion of their Combined State

- (2) assurances, certifications, and other forms required by statute and/or applicable Federal
regulations, including the Education Department General Administrative Regulations
- (EDGAR) at 34 C.F.R. Part 76; (3) budget for the upcoming year; and (4) state-determined
performance levels (SDPLs). ED will provide State Career and Technical Education (CTE)
directors and staff with training, passwords, and technical support to input their information
into the WIOA State Plan Portal and the Perkins State Plan Portal.</p>
<p>States that include SNAP E&amp;T as part of their Combined State Plan will submit their SNAP
E&amp;T specific state plans into the State Plan Portal for WIOA, but must submit annually to
their Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Regional offices a complete SNAP E&amp;T plan that</p>
<p>includes component details, participant levels, and annual operating budget.</p>

<p>g. Performance Negotiations for Core Programs. The Departments will issue separate
technical assistance to outline the requirements for reaching agreement on the negotiated
levels of performance for the states outlined in Section 116 of WIOA. The Departments will
continue to use a “phase-in” approach to establish negotiated and adjusted levels of
performance for certain indicators for specific programs. The appendix in the Unified and
Combined State Plan ICR discussed in this section, and in Appendix 111 of this technical
assistance, reflect which indicators/programs the Departments will negotiate for PYs 2020
and 2021. See Attachment I of this technical assistance for more instructions on establishing
performance levels and acceptable baseline indicators.</p>

<li>
<p>h. Special Instructions for Single-Area States. Single-area states must complete and submit
any information required in the local plan as part of their State Plan submission. Item V1.d
in the Title I portion of the WIOA State Plan ICR specifies these requirements.</p>

<p>Requirements and Request Process, the Secretary of Labor may grant states additional
flexibility through the waiver authority for portions of WIOA Title I and Wagner-Peyser Act
requirements when permitted. Waivers are a tool for reducing barriers to WIOA
implementation and spurring innovative programming options. States may submit waiver
requests as part of their State Plan or as a separate waiver plan.</p>
<p>All currently approved waivers expire on June 30, 2020. Therefore, states should submit</p>
<p>new waiver requests as part of the PY 2020-2023 State Plan submission if they wish to
continue implementing particular waivers that had been approved previously (See Section
189(i)(3) of WIOA). As articulated in waiver approval letters, states agreed to meet certain
performance or other program performance measures resulting from the waiver. States
requesting a waiver renewal beyond June 30, 2020, must provide the most recent data
available about the outcomes of the waiver in the renewal request.12 DOL will consider this
information as part of its decision to approve the requested waiver.</p>
<ul>
<li>j. Modifications. Given the multiyear nature of the State Plan, states must revisit State Plan
strategies regularly, reassess their effectiveness and labor market relevance, and when
needed, adjust these strategies to respond to the changing economic conditions and
workforce needs of the state. At a minimum, states must submit a modification to the
Unified or Combined State Plan at the end of the first two-year period of any four-year plan,
and under specific circumstances.13 However, states may submit off-cycle modifications to
the Unified or Combined State Plan to reflect major changes or revisions in state strategies,
organizational structures, and implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Departments have determined that for any Combined State Plan program included in the
plan with a different planning cycle from that required by Title I of WIOA, states should
submit program-specific modifications to the Combined State Plan that align with the
planning cycles for those specific programs, unless the two-year WIOA modification cycle
can accommodate programs' planning and modification cycle. For example, if a state
chooses to include career and technical education programs under the Perkins V Act as a part
of its Combined State Plan, the state would submit program-specific plan modifications
annually to align with the Perkins V Act's state plan cycle, as necessary. These changes
would not necessitate a modification to the Combined State Plan, as a whole, unless the
revisions triggered a required State Plan modification pursuant to section 103(b)(1) of
WIOA. Such modifications must be submitted to the Secretary of the appropriate department
for that program directly, in addition to DOL and ED via the WIOA State Plan Portal, as
necessary. For example, the TANF law requires a state to submit a plan within 27 months of
the end of the first fiscal quarter in order to receive TANF funds for that fiscal year.
Therefore, adopting the more frequent two-year WIOA cycle for modifications should
accommodate TANF's cycle, allowing a state to make all changes to each portion of the</p>

<p>Appendix 1: Performance Goals and Instructions for the Core Programs Consistent with</p>
<h2 id="section-116b3-of-wioa">Section 116(b)(3) of WIOA</h2>
<p>Each state submitting a Unified or Combined State Plan is required to identify expected levels of
performance for each of the primary indicators of performance for the first two years covered by
the plan. The state is required to reach agreement with the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction
with the Secretary of Education, on state-negotiated levels of performance for the indicators for
each of the first two years of the plan.</p>
<p>For PY 2016-2019 plans, the Departments used the transition authority under section 503(a) of
WIOA to designate certain primary indicators of performance as “baseline” indicators to ensure
an orderly transition from the requirements of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to those
under WIOA. A “baseline” indicator was one for which states did not propose an expected level
of performance and did not come to agreement with the Departments on negotiated levels of</p>
<p>performance because sufficient data were not available to establish such performance levels. As
a result, “baseline” indicators were not used in the end of the year adjustment of performance
levels and were not used to determine failure to meet adjusted levels of performance for purposes
of sanctions. The Departments designated indicators as “baseline” based on the likelihood of a
State having insufficient data with which to make a reasonable determination of an expected
level of performance.</p>
<p>For PYs 2020-2023 State Plans, the Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, and AEFLA programs
will have two full years of data available to make reasonable determinations of expected levels
of performance for the following indicators for PY 2020 and PY 2021:
- •  Employment (Second Quarter after Exit);
- •  Employment (Fourth Quarter after Exit);
- •  Median Earnings (Second Quarter after Exit);</p>
<ul>
<li>•  Credential Attainment Rate; and</li>
<li>•  Measurable Skill Gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wagner-Peyser program will have two full years of data available to make a reasonable
determination of expected levels of performance for the following indicators for PY 2020 and</p>
<h1 id="py-2021">PY 2021:</h1>
<ul>
<li>•  Employment (Second Quarter after Exit);</li>
<li>•  Employment (Fourth Quarter after Exit); and</li>
<li>•  Median Earnings (Second Quarter after Exit).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Credential Attainment Rate and Measurable Skill Gains indicators do not apply to the</p>
<p>Wagner-Peyser Act ES program; therefore, this program will not submit expected levels of
performance for these indicators.</p>
<p>For the first two years of PYs 2020-2023 State Plans, the VR program will have two full years of
data available for the Measurable Skill Gains indicator only. Therefore, the Departments will
designate the following indicators as “baseline” for the VR program for PY 2020 and PY 2021:
- •  Employment (Second Quarter after Exit);
- •  Employment (Fourth Quarter after Exit);</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-12">Page 12</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  Median Earnings (Second Quarter after Exit); and</li>
<li>•  Credential Attainment Rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>VR agencies must continue to collect and report on all indicators, including those that have been
designated as “baseline, pursuant to section 116(d) of WIOA.” The actual performance data</p>
<p>reported by these programs for indicators designated as “baseline” for PY 2020 and PY 2021
will serve as baseline data in future years. The Departments will require VR agencies to submit
expected levels of performance for these indicators for PY 2022 and PY 2023.</p>
<p>The Departments determined that the Effectiveness in Serving Employers indicator will be
measured as a shared outcome across all six core programs within each state to ensure a holistic
approach to serving employers. The Departments will continue piloting approaches for
measuring this indicator for the first two years of PY 2020-2023 plans. Therefore, states are not
required to submit an expected level of performance for the Effectiveness in Serving Employers
indicator for PY 2020 and PY 2021. However, core programs are expected to collect data and
report on this indicator for PY 2020 and PY 2021 as they did for PYs 2016-2019 plans.</p>
<p>Each core program must submit an expected level of performance for all of the other indicators,
as applicable, with the exception of the four indicators designated as “baseline” for the VR
program in PY 2020 and PY 2021. The Departments will work with states during the
negotiation process to establish negotiated levels of performance for each of the primary</p>
<p>indicators for the core programs not listed as “baseline.” Each state must update its plan to
include the agreed-upon negotiated levels of performance before the Departments approve a
state’s plan.</p>
<p>States may identify additional indicators in the plan, including additional approaches to
measuring Effectiveness in Serving Employers, and may establish levels of performance for each
of the state indicators. Please identify any such state indicators under Additional Indicators of</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance.</h2>
