<h1 id="purpose">PURPOSE:</h1>
<p>The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), within the U.S. Department of Education’s
- (Department) Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, issues this technical
assistance circular (TAC) to support State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies’ efforts and
the mutual efforts of community rehabilitation programs, employers, families, and other
stakeholders to maximize VR and supported employment services and supports that assist
individuals with disabilities in achieving long-term labor market attachment in “competitive
integrated employment,” as defined in Section 7(5) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</p>
<p>(Rehabilitation Act), and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(9). State VR agencies’ intentional efforts and
maximum investment of resources to provide comprehensive quality VR services will lead to
improved employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their unique
strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice, that offer family-sustaining wages, long-term
labor market attachment, and the opportunity for career advancement. Additionally, investing
substantially in VR services and training that assists VR program participants to develop optimal
skills and educational credentials will help to transform and improve workplace perceptions of
the value of workers with disabilities and promote equity of employment opportunities for
today’s VR program participants and future generations of workers with disabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, this TAC describes how VR agencies can maximize the use of funds to provide
services that will strengthen quality employment outcomes through participant engagement,
informed choice, investment in postsecondary training, access to assistive technology and critical
support services, work-based learning experiences and apprenticeships, and meaningful
partnerships within the workforce development system.</p>

<h1 id="technical-assistance">TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:</h1>
<p>As authorized under the Rehabilitation Act, RSA provides Federal grant awards to assist States
in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable VR
programs. State VR agencies are integral partners in their statewide workforce development and
educational systems and are responsible for assessing, planning, developing, and providing VR
services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with the individuals’ unique strengths,
resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice so that they
may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-
sufficiency (Section 100(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.1). Thus, VR
agencies are positioned to provide a range of services that contribute to improved “employment
outcomes,” as defined in Section 7(11) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(15) for
individuals with disabilities, including services that increase access to the VR program for</p>
<p>individuals with disabilities who have diverse life-experiences and are often underserved.</p>
<p>The continuum of VR services offered by VR agencies provides opportunity for early
engagement, career exploration, education and training, support services, and invaluable
workforce experience. In today’s ever-changing economy, it is paramount for VR agencies to
evaluate their current service delivery models, develop a strategic approach to make full use of
available funds, and assist individuals with disabilities to compete for high-paying careers in
science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), green industries, critical infrastructure fields,
and other expanding industries. The discussion below highlights potential strategies for
intentional investments in the provision of services to individuals with disabilities, including
those with the most significant disabilities, to strengthen the attainment and long-term retention
of competitive integrated employment.</p>
<h2 id="early-engagement-of-students-and-youth">Early Engagement of Students and Youth</h2>
<p>VR agencies and State educational agencies (SEA) can play a critical role in helping students</p>
<p>and youth with disabilities and their families set high expectations for rewarding future careers
and self-sufficiency. The formal agreement between the VR agency and the SEA must have
clearly defined parameters for collaborating and coordinating the delivery of pre-employment
transition services, as well as transition services that pave the way toward postsecondary success
with clearly defined responsibilities for each entity as described in 34 C.F.R. § 361.22. Together,
VR agencies and SEAs can ensure and coordinate services for students with disabilities that will
lead to the development of high-quality postsecondary transition, career planning, and outcomes.
Through outreach to parent, advocacy, and consumer organizations -- which offer information
and support as well as mentoring and exposure to role models -- and active coordination with
local educational agencies (LEAs) in transition planning activities associated with students’
individualized education programs (IEPs), VR agencies can introduce students and youth with
disabilities to the many opportunities and advantages offered through the VR program.
Specifically, VR agencies can introduce the earliest set of services in the continuum of available
VR services, i.e., “pre-employment transition services,” defined in Section 7(30) of the
Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(42), to engage all “students with disabilities,”
defined in Section 7(37) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(51), regardless of</p>
<p>whether they have applied or been determined eligible for the VR program. Pre-employment</p>
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p>transition services provide the opportunity for engagement in career exploration and, for many
students with disabilities and their families, reveal the potential of the world of work in their
future. As VR programs conduct regular assessments of and updates to policies, procedures, and
practices, VR agencies should verify the strategies identified in the VR services portion of the
Unified or Combined State Plan are being fully implemented, including the formal interagency
agreement with the SEA that provides for procedures for outreach to and identification of
students with disabilities who are in need of transition services to move from school to
postsecondary life and pre-employment transition services (34 C.F.R. § 361.22(b)(4)). VR
agencies must make pre-employment transition services available statewide and should provide
equitable access to all students with disabilities (Section 113(a) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34
C.F.R. § 361.48(a)). Additionally, VR agencies should include outreach to bilingual or
multilingual students and families in their communities to help bridge access to and facilitate
early engagement in pre-employment transition services.</p>
<h2 id="section-110d1-of-the-rehabilitation-act-and-34-cfr-36165a3i-require-states-to">Section 110(d)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.65(a)(3)(i) require States to</h2>
<p>reserve at least 15 percent of their Federal VR grant for the provision of pre-employment
transition services. Full investment in the provision of pre-employment transition services is
essential to fulfilling the requirements of Section 113(a) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.48(a), which require State VR agencies to use the reserved funds to provide, or arrange for
the provision of, pre-employment transition services to all students with disabilities in need of
such services who are eligible or potentially eligible for services under the VR program. On
February 28, 2020, the Department published a notice of interpretation in the Federal Register
(85 FR 11848) to clarify policy regarding the permissibility of using funds reserved for pre-
employment transition services for auxiliary aids and services, as appropriate, for all students
with disabilities, and for other VR services needed by students with disabilities determined
eligible for the VR program to support their access to and participation in pre-employment
transition services. VR services to eligible individuals are described in Section 103(a) of the
Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.48(b) and are provided in accordance with an approved
individualized plan for employment (IPE).</p>
<p>VR agencies are encouraged to assess their current approach to the delivery and expansion of
pre-employment transition services activities such as job exploration counseling, work-based
learning experiences, counseling on opportunities for enrollment in comprehensive transition or
postsecondary educational programs at institutions of higher education (IHE), workplace
readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy (Section 113(b) of the Rehabilitation Act and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-36148a2-they-should-ensure-policies-procedures-and-practices-align-with-the">34 C.F.R. § 361.48(a)(2)). They should ensure policies, procedures, and practices align with the</h2>
<p>permissibility, flexibility, and expenditure of funds reserved for allowable pre-employment
transition services, resulting in, at a minimum, the required expenditure of the reserved funds for
the benefit of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Early engagement of students and youth requires a commitment by VR agencies to attract these
individuals and their families through meaningful and effective outreach strategies and in a
relatable manner that demonstrates the valuable benefits and services available to participants in
the VR program. To that end, the services should be effective, reflective of their needs,
efficiently provided, and comprehensive to make their VR journey worthwhile.</p>

<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<h2 id="eligibility-and-continued-engagement-in-the-vr-process">Eligibility and Continued Engagement in the VR Process</h2>
<p>While students with disabilities may be introduced to the VR program while in school, for many
individuals with disabilities, introduction to VR services occurs at referral or application to a VR
agency by other programs and entities including the local American job centers. The initial
interaction of individuals with disabilities with VR agencies creates the expectations and begins
the experiences critical to ongoing engagement and an individual’s long-term success. Investing
in timely processing of referrals and applications (34 C.F.R. § 361.41) and subsequent eligibility
determinations as outlined in 34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a) helps foster active participation and
meaningful interactions between eligible individuals and VR counseling staff. Additionally,
prompt engagement and the establishment of an ongoing positive relationship can result in VR
agencies experiencing less attrition of applicants and eligible individuals, ultimately creating a
greater opportunity to maximize the use of funds to benefit and serve a larger number of</p>
<p>individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>When determining whether an individual is eligible for VR services, there are prohibited factors
(34 C.F.R. § 361.42(c)). The designated State unit (DSU) must ensure that no applicant or group
of applicants is excluded or found ineligible solely based on the type of disability. The DSU
must also ensure that eligibility requirements are applied without regard to the factors in 34
C.F.R. § 361.42(c)(2), including the type of expected employment outcome, an applicant’s
employment history or current employment status, and an applicant’s educational status or
current educational credential. Section 102(a)(1)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act allows for an
individual with a disability, whose physical or mental impairment constitutes a substantial
impediment to employment, to be determined eligible for VR services if he or she requires
services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment. RSA interprets the
phrase “advance in employment,” as used in Section 102(a)(1)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-36142a1iii-broadly-to-include-advancement-within-an-individuals-current">34 C.F.R. § 361.42(a)(1)(iii), broadly to include advancement within an individual’s current</h2>
<p>employment or advancement into new employment. As VR agencies conduct regular
assessments of and updates to policies, procedures, and practices, they must ensure there are no</p>
<p>prohibitive approaches related to eligibility determinations when an applicant is interested in
obtaining education or training to advance their career in current or future employment (34
C.F.R. § 361.42(c)(2)(ii)). VR agencies should understand and make every effort to mitigate and
remove the substantial impediments and barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities in
achieving or advancing in quality employment by maximizing services and providing the
necessary resources to enhance and expand opportunities for meaningful careers.</p>
<p>Continuous engagement contributes to the quality of substantial vocational rehabilitation
counseling and guidance, fosters active participation in VR services, enriches the development of
the IPE, supports the achievement of milestones, and improves the likelihood of successful
employment outcomes. Notwithstanding the challenge of staff limitations, which may require
some innovative restructuring or realignment, VR agencies should understand the flexibilities
when establishing an order of selection and carefully evaluate the need for implementing an
order of selection, especially when funds are available to serve all individuals determined
eligible for VR services. In the event that a VR agency is operating under an order of selection
and has one or more closed priority categories (Section 101(a)(5) of the Rehabilitation Act and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-36136-it-is-required-to-provide-information-and-referral-services-to-individuals-with">34 C.F.R. § 361.36), it is required to provide information and referral services to individuals with</h2>
<p>4</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>disabilities to other appropriate Federal and State programs, including other components of the
statewide workforce development system as outlined in Section 101(a)(20) of the Rehabilitation
Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.37. An individual’s record of service must contain the documentation
on the nature and scope of services provided by the DSU to the individual and on the referral
itself, consistent with the requirements of 34 C.F.R. § 361.37 (34 C.F.R. § 361.47(a)(13)).
Information and referral services could be used routinely to engage and maintain contact with
individuals who are in a closed priority of service category through the provision of accurate VR
information and guidance (which may include counseling and referral for job placement) using
appropriate modes of communication to assist them in preparing for, securing, retaining,
advancing in, or regaining employment. Investments in activities and practices that maintain
regular and meaningful contact may result in an increase in engagement of individuals with
disabilities in VR services, reduce the number of case closures prior to plan, and increase
successful employment outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="maximizing-informed-choice-in-ipe-development-and-employment-goals">Maximizing Informed Choice in IPE Development and Employment Goals</h2>
<p>VR agencies should employ methods and principles that ensure the use of VR funds to the
greatest extent possible for the purpose of supporting and maximizing competitive integrated
employment outcomes and careers for individuals with disabilities. Section 100(a)(3) of the
Rehabilitation Act outlines the principles by which a VR program must be carried out, including
the requirement that individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in
such programs must be active and full partners in the VR process, making meaningful and
informed choices (Section100(a)(3)(C) of the Rehabilitation Act). The Rehabilitation Act clearly
places an emphasis on informed choice by requiring agencies to develop and implement an IPE
in a manner that affords eligible individuals the opportunity to exercise informed choice in
selecting an employment outcome, the specific VR services to be provided under the plan, the
entity that will provide the VR services, and the methods used to procure the services (Section
102(b)(3)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act). Agencies must develop and implement written policies
and procedures that enable an applicant or recipient of services to exercise informed choice</p>
<p>throughout the vocational rehabilitation process (Section 102(d) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34</p>
<h2 id="cfr-36152b">C.F.R. § 361.52(b)).</h2>
<p>A key component of informed choice and IPE development is financial literacy, including
information related to the potential effects of employment on Social Security and other benefits
that will dispel misinformation or misperceptions about the effect of work on their benefits and
help individuals with disabilities to make well-informed decisions about the employment goals
that best suit their needs. Section 102(b)(2) of the Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.45(c)(3) require VR
agencies to provide benefits planning information, including information about work incentives
provided through the Social Security Administration (SSA). If the VR agency is unable to
provide benefits planning, the VR agency should make a referral to a local certified work
incentives practitioner or the SSA. Depending on individual circumstances, it may be appropriate
to provide benefits planning during initial phases of the development of the IPE, during the
implementation of the IPE as a service, upon employment, and again, when an individual
receives a pay increase on the job.</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<p>Most often, an eligible individual will be made aware of the wide array of VR services available
through the process of informed choice, decide which services are required for them to achieve
employment, and learn how such services may be provided to assist them in achieving a specific
employment outcome that is “chosen by the eligible individual, consistent with the unique
strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of
the eligible individual, [and] consistent with the general goal of competitive integrated
employment” (Section 102(b)(4) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.46(a)(1)).
Considering entry level jobs that do not reflect the full intent of the employment goal should not
be encouraged over providing all the necessary services and making the appropriate expenditures
to ensure the achievement of the IPE goal. The cost or the extent of VR services that an eligible
individual may need to achieve a particular employment goal should not be a factor when
considering or identifying the goal in the individual’s IPE.</p>
<p>Agency policy and practices should reflect the requirement of informed choice to ensure eligible
individuals are made aware of the availability of in-State and out-of-State services related to
career, training, and other support services without regard to cost, labor market conditions (if the
individual is willing to relocate), or complexity of coordination for services. Out-of-State
services can support an individual’s informed choice and employment goal when the availability
of in-State service providers is insufficient, non-existent, or cannot meet the unique needs of the
individual. Once the employment goal is identified, agencies are authorized to employ strategies
that are consistent with Federal law and are obligated to locate comparable services and benefits
for certain VR services (34 C.F.R. §§ 361.53 and 361.54). There is no Federal requirement that
the financial need of individuals be considered in the provision of VR services (34 C.F.R. §
361.54(a)). VR agencies are encouraged to review, revise, or eliminate policies and practices
related to financial needs tests and cost participation that may limit or discourage individuals
with disabilities in their choice to access VR services or in the selection of career goals.</p>
<h2 id="postsecondary-training">Postsecondary Training</h2>
<p>The Department has a long history of encouraging VR agencies to provide advanced training,
when needed and appropriate, to assist eligible individuals with disabilities in achieving and
maximizing their employment goals. SEAs, LEAs, and VR agencies can work together to
provide counseling on opportunities for enrollment in comprehensive transition or postsecondary
educational programs at IHEs as one of the required activities under pre-employment transition
services. Furthermore, they can promote opportunities for work-based learning experiences, and
support eligible individuals in pre-apprenticeships, registered apprenticeships, and postsecondary
training leading to recognized industry credentials. While VR agencies are required to enter into
interagency agreements with public IHEs for purposes of negotiating financial responsibilities
for accommodations and auxiliary aids and services (Section 101(a)(8)(B) of the Rehabilitation
Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.53(d)), VR agencies may also seek additional avenues for greater
collaboration to facilitate postsecondary services and success for individuals with disabilities
(e.g., IHE disability services and 504 coordinators). Additionally, VR agencies can support dual
enrollment activities (e.g., courses offered by a community college or other postsecondary
education institution program where students earn college credit prior to high school graduation
or participate in comprehensive transition programs) for secondary students with disabilities who</p>
<p>have been determined eligible for the VR program by providing needed services to enable them</p>
<p>6</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<p>to fully access and participate in these opportunities. Section 103(a)(18) of the Rehabilitation Act
specifically permits VR agencies to provide VR services that encourage qualified eligible
individuals to pursue advanced training in the STEM fields, medicine, law, or business. Section
103(a)(5) of the Rehabilitation Act has historically permitted VR agencies to provide training at
IHEs, including in advanced degree programs, to qualified eligible individuals, and the
availability of support for graduate-level education in STEM and other fields through the VR
program is reinforced in 34 C.F.R. § 361.48(b)(6).</p>
<p>VR agencies’ policies that restrict or place limitations on the type, degree, and costs of support
provided to individuals attending both in-State and out-of-State postsecondary IHEs can deter
opportunities for individuals with disabilities to maximize their employment and careers. The
full investment in postsecondary training offers VR agencies an avenue for continuous
improvement in performance and the quality of employment outcomes for the individuals they</p>
<p>serve.</p>
<p>Postsecondary training services assist individuals with obtaining both measurable skill gains and
credential attainment. A “recognized postsecondary credential” is defined in Section 2(52) of the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act as a credential consisting of an industry-recognized
certificate or certification, a certificate of completion of an apprenticeship, a license recognized
by the State involved or Federal government, or an associate or baccalaureate degree, as well as
graduate degrees for purposes of the VR program as required by Section 103(a)(5) of the
Rehabilitation Act. To support attainment of a postsecondary credential, a VR agency’s
assistance could include graduate-level postsecondary education, as appropriate for the
individual, if necessary to achieve the advancement in employment specified in the vocational
goal on the individual’s approved IPE or when such advanced career and technical training is
required to compete for STEM careers, green industries, critical infrastructure fields, and other
expanding industries.</p>
<p>Postsecondary training, including participation in career pathways programs focused on industry-</p>
<p>recognized certificates or apprenticeships, can lead to credential attainment and good-paying
competitive integrated employment outcomes. Career pathways are designed to serve a diverse
group of learners, including youth, dislocated workers, veterans, individuals with disabilities,
individuals who have low levels of literacy or English proficiency, new immigrants, women, and
minorities. Career pathways programs, often a component of career training located within
community colleges, provide opportunities for more flexible education and training, allow
people to earn industry-sought credentials, and support the attainment of marketable skills that
position individuals with disabilities to be highly desired candidates in today’s competitive labor
market. Interagency collaboration among VR agencies, SEAs and LEAs, and Career Technical
Education (CTE) can result in strategic enhancements and strengthened transition programming
to support students with disabilities in achieving career goals.</p>
<h2 id="assistive-technology-and-other-support-services">Assistive Technology and Other Support Services</h2>
<p>The overarching principle that individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most
significant disabilities, are capable of achieving and advancing in competitive integrated</p>
<p>employment, when provided the appropriate supports and services (Section 100(a)(1)(C) of the</p>
<p>7</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation Act), is woven throughout the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act and regulations
in 34 C.F.R. parts 361 and 363. As VR programs conduct regular assessments of and updates to
policies, procedures, and practices, agencies should ensure the strategies identified in the VR
services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan are being fully implemented, including
the provision of assistive technology services and assistive technology devices at each stage of
the rehabilitation process (34 C.F.R. § 361.29(d)(1)). To improve equity in educational success
for students with disabilities, SEAs and LEAs should work cooperatively with VR agencies to
provide needed supports and services; however, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. 361.22(c), nothing
must be construed to reduce the obligation under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
- (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) of a LEA or any other agency to provide or pay for any
transition services that are also considered special education or related services and that are
necessary for ensuring a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities within the</p>
<h2 id="state-involved">State involved.</h2>
<p>To ensure full access to employment opportunities, VR agencies are encouraged to invest in and
provide VR services, including rehabilitation and assistive technologies, that maximize the
employment success of individuals with disabilities. Section 3 of the Assistive Technology Act
of 1998, Section 7(3) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(6)) define assistive
technology, assistive technology device, and assistive technology service. Assistive technology
is a broad term that encompasses any technology that is used in an assistive device or assistive
technology service. An assistive technology device is any item, piece of equipment, or product
system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase,
maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. An assistive
technology service encompasses the services that directly assist an individual with a disability in
the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device (Section 3 of the Assistive
Technology Act). Rehabilitation technology (Section 7(32) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34
C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(45)) includes assistive technology devices and services. Leveraging
rehabilitation technology solutions, including vehicular modification, telecommunications,
sensory, and other technological aids and devices (34 C.F.R. § 361.48(b)(17)) to remove barriers</p>
<p>and improve access to the range of available VR services for potentially eligible students and
eligible individuals is one example of a critical investment in appropriate supports and services.</p>
<p>When an individual with a most significant disability, including a youth with a most significant
disability, is supported in their competitive integrated employment setting, including customized
employment, with readily available and easy to access on-the-job supports, they are often most
successful in maintaining employment. VR agencies are encouraged to focus efforts on and
investments in the seamless delivery of supported employment services (Section 7(39) of the
Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(54) and as outlined in 34 C.F.R. part 363), including
the transition to extended services (Section 7(13) of the Rehabilitation Act, 34 C.F.R. §
361.5(c)(19), and 34 C.F.R. § 363.4(b)). Individuals with the most significant disabilities who
require supported employment (Section 7(38) of the Rehabilitation Act, 34 C.F.R. §
361.5(c)(53)(i), and 34 C.F.R. § 363.1(b)) receive the maximum benefit from supported

<p>authorized to provide, and fund extended services for a period not to exceed four years, or such
time that a youth reaches the age of 25 and no longer meets the definition of a “youth with a
disability” under 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(58), whichever occurs first (34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(19) and</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-3634a2-when-making-investments-in-supporting-youth-with-the-most">34 C.F.R. § 363.4(a)(2)). When making investments in supporting youth with the most</h2>
<p>significant disabilities VR agencies may need to develop policies, procedures, and practices to
ensure expenditures for extended services for youth are readily available and offered by the VR
agency, particularly when no other source of extended services is available.</p>

<p>VR agencies are uniquely positioned to influence the employment success of individuals with
disabilities through the investment in training and services to employers as outlined in 34 C.F.R.</p>
<p>§ 361.32(c). Quite simply, employers should have access to skilled workers to compete in the
global economy, and skilled workers with disabilities should have access to high-paying careers
in areas such as STEM, green industries, critical infrastructure fields, and other expanding
industries. VR agencies are required to provide consultation, technical assistance, and support to
employers on workplace accommodations, assistive technology, and accessibility of facilities to
enable the employers to recruit, job match, hire, and retain qualified individuals with disabilities
who are recipients of or applicants for VR services. Additionally, VR agencies must ensure the
VR services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan describes how the DSU will work
with employers to identify competitive integrated employment opportunities and career
exploration opportunities (34 C.F.R. § 361.24(c)). Work-based learning experiences arranged
through the collaboration of VR agencies, SEAs and LEAs, and employers offer students with
disabilities an excellent opportunity to explore interests and the world of work, raise family and
individual expectations for the future, and build the soft skills that will open the door to post-
school employment. Strategies and investments around these efforts will assist VR agencies in
gaining a better understanding of the local labor market, developing meaningful relationships
with employers and other partners in the workforce development system, designing VR services</p>
<p>and training to meet employer needs, and providing opportunities for cross-agency coordination
to help improve competitive integrated employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities.
When businesses are engaged with the technical expertise of VR agencies to support their efforts
to recruit, train, and promote individuals with disabilities, they are better positioned to hire and
retain skilled employees, and individuals with disabilities are better empowered to achieve long-
term labor market attachment in competitive integrated employment.</p>
<h1 id="summary">SUMMARY:</h1>
<p>Through maximizing all available resources, VR agencies are uniquely positioned to provide
necessary VR services, including pre-employment transition services, education and training,
assistive technology, and other appropriate supports that strengthen the viability of attainment
and retention of employment outcomes that are consistent with the strengths, abilities, interests,
and informed choice of individuals with disabilities. VR agencies should be coordinating efforts
with SEAs and LEAs in the provision of meaningful and necessary services for all students with
disabilities, as early as possible during the transition planning process, including pre-</p>
<p>employment transition services under the VR program, special education and related services
under IDEA, and accommodations for students with disabilities for purposes of Section 504 of</p>
<p>9</p>

<p>the Rehabilitation Act. Today’s economy has created demand for highly skilled talent to compete
for high-paying positions in STEM careers, green industries, critical infrastructure fields, and
other expanding industries. For individuals with disabilities engaged in VR services, the
pathways to employment are varied and must be provided incorporating informed choice
throughout the process and maximizing available services that will lead to quality employment.
By regularly assessing and updating policies, procedures, and practices, VR agencies can inform
the development and implementation of strategies to maximize the use of funds for providing VR
services that elevate the competitiveness of individuals with disabilities in the local, regional,
and global labor markets. State VR agencies should make full use of available funds by aligning
the provision of the continuum of VR services with the permissibility and flexibility of using
funds, increasing access and equity in employment, and leveraging the wide array of available
services to provide multiple pathways to lasting careers and economic growth and success for
individuals with disabilities.</p>
