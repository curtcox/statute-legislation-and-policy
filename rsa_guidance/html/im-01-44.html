<h2 id="issue-this-information-memorandum-im-provides-clarification-of-the">ISSUE:         This Information Memorandum (IM) provides clarification of the</h2>
<p>relationship between the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program
(VR program) under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,
and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA). Specifically, the issue addressed herein is whether the uniform
standards and requirements under the HIPAA implementing regulations</p>
<p>that govern the electronic transmission of certain health information
within the health care industry apply to designated State agencies (VR
agencies) administering a State’s VR program.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION:    We have consulted extensively with the U.S. Department of Health and</p>
<h2 id="human-services-hhs-the-federal-agency-responsible-for-administering">Human Services (HHS), the Federal agency responsible for administering</h2>
<p>HIPAA, on this issue and have learned that, for the reasons set forth
below, the requirements governing electronic transmission of health care
information – in particular, the Administrative Simplification provisions in
Subtitle F of title II under HIPAA and in 45 CFR Parts 160 and 162 – do
not apply to State VR agencies.</p>
<h2 id="the-scope-of-entities-subject-to-the-electronic-transmission-standards">The scope of entities subject to the electronic transmission standards</h2>
<p>developed under HIPAA regulations was clarified in final regulations
promulgated by HHS on December 28, 2000 (65 FR 82461) which, along
with final regulations published on August 17, 2000 (65 FR 50312),</p>
<p>establish requirements pertaining to electronic transactions between health</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p>industry entities covered by HIPAA.1 The December 28, 2000
regulations, like those published in August, identify “health plans, health
care providers, and health care clearinghouses” as “covered entities” that
must comply with the transaction codes in 45 CFR Part 162 whenever they
transmit certain health information electronically. For purposes of
administering the VR program, however, State VR agencies do not qualify
as one of the three covered entities.</p>
<p>This position, which we have confirmed with HHS, is based on the
regulatory definitions of the entities covered by the HIPAA regulations.
First, the December 28, 2000, regulations revised the definition of the term
“health plan” under 45 CFR §160.103. While a “health plan” includes any
“individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of, medical care,”</p>
<p>subsection (2)(ii) of the definition specifically excludes:</p>
<p>“a government-funded program . . . whose principal purpose is
other than providing, or paying the cost of, health care.”</p>
<h2 id="while-state-vr-agencies-may-under-certain-conditions-expend-vr">While State VR agencies may, under certain conditions, expend VR</h2>
<p>program funds to pay for the diagnosis and treatment of an eligible
individual’s physical or mental impairment when necessary for the
individual to achieve his or her employment goal (see section 103(a)(6) of
the Rehabilitation Act and 34 CFR §361.48(e) of the VR program
regulations), the provision of medical care is not the primary purpose of
the VR program. Instead, the VR program is “designed to assess, plan,
develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals
with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities,
concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that
such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment” (see</p>
<p>section 100(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act). Thus, the VR program is not
a “health plan” as defined in the HIPAA regulations.</p>
<p>Nor does the regulatory definition of “health care provider” [“a provider
of . . . medical or health services, and any other person or organization
who furnishes, bills, or is paid for health care in the normal course of
business”] accurately describe the VR program. Preamble language to the
December 28, 2000, final regulations makes it clear that “health care
providers” include entities that actually provide diagnostic and
preventative care and sell and dispense drugs. Providers of health care
services include entities such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home</p>

<p>information systems. The first final regulations in this set, Standards for Electronic Transactions, were
promulgated on August 17, 2000 (65 Federal Register 50312). The second final regulations in the set,
Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, were promulgated on December 28, 2000
(65 Federal Register 82461). Additional rules have been proposed, while others have yet to be proposed.
Although the regulations promulgated on December 28, 2000 establish the Standards for Privacy, they also
amended certain definitions that had been promulgated in August and are relevant to the issue at hand.</p>

<p>health agencies, hospice programs, etc. (See 65 FR 82477-82478). In
contrast, a VR agency, in arranging and paying for physical and mental
restoration services (see 34 CFR §§361.5(b)(40) and 361.48(e)) in certain,
limited instances under the VR program, does not “furnish… health care”
as the term is used in 45 C.F.R. §160.103. Thus, VR agencies are not
“health care providers” as defined in the HIPAA regulations.</p>
<h2 id="finally-the-regulatory-definition-of-a-health-care-clearinghouse-a">Finally, the regulatory definition of a “health care clearinghouse” [“a</h2>
<p>public or private entity, including a billing service, repricing company,
community health management information system or community health
information system, and “value-added” networks and switches, . . . that
processes or facilitates the processing of health information . . . “] under</p>
<h2 id="45-cfr-160103-does-not-accurately-describe-the-vr-program">45 CFR §160.103 does not accurately describe the VR program.</h2>
<h2 id="accordingly-hipaa-does-not-obligate-vr-agencies-to-adopt-the">Accordingly, HIPAA does not obligate VR agencies to adopt the</h2>
<p>electronic transaction standards in Part 162 when providing health
information to, or receiving health information from, a health care
provider or other “covered entity” in the course of administering the VR
program.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:    In summary, neither HIPAA nor its implementing regulations obligate
State VR agencies to conform to the regulatory standards for electronic
transmission of health information for purposes of administering the VR
program.</p>
<p>While RSA has confirmed this position with HHS, this interpretation does
not affect any decision by a State to adopt standards for electronic
transmission that would cover the VR agency. The electronic codes or
standards that a VR agency is expected to follow when exchanging health
information or processing health care transactions is a matter of State</p>
<p>discretion.</p>
