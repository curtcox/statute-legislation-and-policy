<h1 id="policy">POLICY:</h1>
<p>Through this Policy Directive (PD), the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is
transmitting a copy of the revised RSA-7-OB form for the ILOIB program. The Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) has approved an extension with changes to this information
collection (OMB control number 1820-0608) until December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The ILOIB program provides independent living services to persons age 55 or older who are
blind or visually impaired. RSA uses this form to meet the specific data collection requirements
of Chapter 2 of Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV of the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), and implementing regulations at 34
C.F.R. Part 367. Each designated State agency (DSA) that administers the ILOIB program is
required to submit the RSA-7-OB form annually to the RSA Commissioner on or before</p>
<h2 id="december-31">December 31.</h2>
<p>The recently approved RSA-7-OB form and instructions have streamlined and clarified some of
the items in the previous information collection. In addition, this form collects data on five
program measures that will assist RSA with more accurate measurement of the performance of
the ILOIB program. Training will be provided in the near future to help agencies implement
this revised information collection.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-timeline">Implementation Timeline</h2>
<p>For Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2020, DSAs should continue to use the previously approved
RSA-7-OB form to collect and report data no later than December 31, 2020. Beginning with
FFY 2021, which begins on October 1, 2020, DSAs must use the revised RSA-7-OB form and
instructions (see attached); these data must be reported to RSA by December 31, 2021.</p>
<p>1</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<h2 id="electronic-submission">Electronic Submission</h2>
<p>DSAs administering the ILOIB program must submit the RSA-7-OB form electronically
through the RSA-7-OB portal on RSA’s website at https://rsa.ed.gov. RSA recommends that
staff responsible for reporting this data visit RSA’s website to ensure their user account is
active and that they have access to the RSA-7-OB form in the portal. Instructions for users are
available online.</p>

<p>In this section, report allowable expenditures made in support of the
OIB program in the reported FFY. For the purpose of this data
collection, the term ”expenditures” means charges made by a non-
Federal entity to the Federal OIB award (2 C.F.R. § 200.34).</p>
<p>In this data collection, expenditures are to be reported under two
categories, (1) administrative costs, and (2) direct service costs.</p>

<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p>§ 367.61 are reported separately from allowable OIB expenditures made
from other Federal and non-Federal sources. However, OIB grantees
remain responsible for tracking specific information related to the
expenditure of OIB funds from each source. For example, specific
information on expenditures made from the OIB Federal award and from
non-Federal sources used in meeting the match requirement must be
reported on the SF-425.</p>

sub-grants. For example, if an administrator spends a portion of
his or her time providing administrative services and the remainder
providing direct services, include only the expenditures for
administrative services.</p>

“Direct Services.” For example, assuming a full-time 40 hour work
week, if 20% (8 hours per week) of a staff person’s time was spent on
administrative and support functions related to this program, and 80%
(32 hours per week) of the staff person’s time was spent in providing
direct services for this program, the reported FTE for that staff
