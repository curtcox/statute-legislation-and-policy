<h2 id="rehabilitation-services-program">Rehabilitation Services Program</h2>
<h1 id="purpose">PURPOSE:</h1>
<p>The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) provides this technical assistance circular
- (TAC) to promote a better understanding of the various allowable sources of non-Federal match
available under the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program. With this improved knowledge
and understanding of available sources of match, State VR agencies should be able to maximize
the expenditure of available Federal funds to increase competitive integrated employment and
supported employment outcomes and self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities participating
in the VR program, thereby minimizing the amount of Federal VR funds left unspent each year.
RSA is reissuing, with updates, RSA-TAC-11-02: Sources of Non-Federal Share for the</p>
<p>Vocational Rehabilitation Program, previously issued on August 16, 2011. RSA has updated legal
citations and examples of other allowable sources of match, such as certain expenditures incurred
under the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program (RSVFP).</p>
<p>RSA routinely receives inquiries regarding options available to VR agencies to obtain
non-Federal matching funds so they may more easily satisfy the matching requirement for
the VR program required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), and VR
program regulations. Although the specifics of these inquiries differ, they all describe an existing
or potential deficit in non-Federal funding for the VR program and seek guidance pertaining to
Federal requirements governing the scope and use of allowable sources of State match.
Therefore, RSA is providing guidance regarding the various allowable sources of non-Federal
match available for use in the VR program.</p>
<h1 id="technical-assistance">TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:</h1>
<p>The VR program is administered through a Federal and State partnership, with the Federal</p>
<p>government contributing no more than 78.7 percent of the total program expenditures. In</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p>recognition of this Federal-State partnership, each State must contribute a non-Federal share
equal to at least 21.3 percent of total VR program expenditures (34 C.F.R. § 361.60(a)(1) and
(b)(1)). By contributing the required non-Federal share through State-appropriated funds or other
allowable sources, States are able to receive approximately $3.69 Federal VR dollars for every
non-Federal dollar to pay for the costs of administering the VR program and, most importantly,
providing critical services to individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most
significant disabilities, as they pursue employment.</p>
<p>When determining what expenditures can count toward the match requirement of the VR
program, the VR agency must first determine whether the cost is allowable with Federal funds
under that program. If the cost is allowable with Federal VR funds, then that same cost is
allowable as a non-Federal expenditure under the VR program and can be used toward satisfying
the program’s match requirement. If the cost is not allowable for any reason, then it may not be</p>
<p>used toward satisfying the match requirement.</p>
<p>In general, the following sources of funds are allowable sources for acquiring match funds for
purposes of the VR program:</p>
<ul>
<li>•  State-appropriated funds;</li>
<li>•  Third-Party Cooperative Arrangements;</li>
<li>•  Interagency transfers;</li>
<li>•  Contributions by private entities;</li>
<li>•  Establishment, development, and improvement of community rehabilitation programs;</li>
</ul>
<p>and
- •  Certain RSVFP expenditures (Business Enterprise Program).</p>
<p>We will discuss each of the above in more detail separately below.</p>
<h2 id="a-allowable-sources-of-match">A.   Allowable Sources of Match</h2>
<h2 id="state-appropriated-funds">State-Appropriated Funds</h2>
<p>In support of the Federal-State partnership, States typically contribute the required non-Federal
share for the VR program through appropriated funds, thus demonstrating their commitment to
the program. State appropriations offer certain advantages as match for the VR program.
Importantly, VR agencies have flexibility to use these funds for allowable administrative costs of
the VR program, in addition to the cost of services, without adhering to specific requirements
associated with other allowable sources of match (i.e., non-State-appropriated funds). Because
State-appropriated funds can be used to support the full range of costs associated with the</p>
<p>administration and operation of the program, VR agencies can use such funds in a highly flexible
manner, directing them toward allowable costs in an area of need more easily.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-cooperative-arrangements">Third-Party Cooperative Arrangements</h2>
<p>VR agencies and other State and local public agencies can enhance and improve the provision of
VR services to individuals with disabilities by entering third-party cooperative arrangements
(TPCAs), which must adhere to the following requirements in 34 C.F.R. § 361.28:</p>

<h2 id="interagency-transfers">Interagency Transfers</h2>
<p>VR agencies can receive non-Federal funds from other State or local public agencies to enhance
and improve the provision of VR services to individuals with disabilities, including persons with
developmental disabilities or mental illness. When expended for VR purposes, VR agencies may
use the non-Federal funds received through such transfers to satisfy the VR program matching
requirements (34 C.F.R. §§ 361.60(b); 2 C.F.R. § 200.306(b)).</p>
<p>It has been RSA’s longstanding policy that State VR agencies could use interagency transfers
from other State and local public agencies toward satisfying their match requirements under the
VR program (notice of proposed rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg. 64476 (December 15, 1995); final
regulations, 62 Fed. Reg. 6308, 6332 (February 11, 1997)). In 2016, when the Department
amended the VR program regulations, the Department codified a cross reference to 2 C.F.R.</p>
<p>§ 200.306(b) in the provisions governing match for the VR program. In so doing, the Department
made clear that the government-wide non-Federal share requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.306(b)
applied to the VR program, unless specifically excluded.</p>
<p>As is true for any other Federal grantee, 2 C.F.R. § 200.306(b), in pertinent part, permits VR
program grantees to use interagency transfers toward satisfying their match requirements so long
as the expenditures paid with such funds—</p>
<ul>
<li>•  Are verifiable from the grantee’s records;</li>
<li>•  Are not used as match for any other grant award;</li>
<li>•  Are necessary for accomplishing the objectives of the VR program;</li>
<li>
<p>•  Are allowable under the Federal cost principles;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>•  Are not paid by the Federal government under another Federal award, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute; and</p>
</li>
<li>•  Conform to applicable requirements of 2 C.F.R. part 200.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributions-by-private-entities">Contributions by Private Entities</h2>
<p>In addition to non-Federal funds from public sources, VR agencies may report match from
allowable VR expenditures incurred with cash contributions from private entities, deposited into
the State VR agency’s account, and earmarked for meeting, in whole or in part, the agency’s
non-Federal share of expenditures under the VR program for—</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>•  Establishment or construction of a Community Rehabilitation Program (CRP) (34 C.F.R.
§ 361.60(b)(3)(i));</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>•  Particular geographic areas when the State cannot otherwise provide the non-Federal
share (34 C.F.R. § 361.60(b)(3)(ii)); and</p>
</li>
<li>•  Other VR purposes provided the expenditures do not benefit the donor in any way
(34 C.F.R. § 361.60(b)(3)(iii)).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<h2 id="establishment-development-or-improvement-of-crps">Establishment, Development, or Improvement of CRPs</h2>
<p>VR agencies may receive contributions from public sources or private donations for non-Federal
match purposes that expand the capacity of CRPs to provide VR services and assist individuals
with disabilities to achieve employment outcomes. When engaging in the establishment,
development, or improvement of a public or nonprofit CRP for the purpose of providing
VR services that promote integration into the community and that prepare individuals with
disabilities for competitive integrated employment, including supported employment and
customized employment (Section 103(b)(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.49(a)(1)), VR agencies must—</p>
<h2 id="1-prior-to-establishing-developing-or-improving-a-crp-conduct-substantial-planning">1. Prior to establishing, developing, or improving a CRP, conduct substantial planning</h2>
<p>activities, including a comprehensive statewide needs assessment demonstrating the need for</p>
<p>such activity, the development of goals and priorities related to the need, and the selection of
strategies for the achievement of the goals, all of which must be included in the agency’s VR
services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan (Sections 101(a)(15)(A), (C) and (D)
of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. §§ 361.29(a), (c), and (d));</p>

<h2 id="3-deliver-the-vr-services-provided-through-establishment-projects-only-to-applicants-for-or">3. Deliver the VR services provided through establishment projects only to applicants for, or</h2>
<p>recipients of, VR services (Section 103(b)(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R.
§ 361.5(c)(16)(i) – (iii)).</p>
<p>VR agencies can use the establishment authority for the sole benefit of individuals with
disabilities served through the VR program by, for example, expanding the availability of
service providers in areas where resources are lacking, particularly in rural locations, or
improving the types of services offered by existing CRPs.</p>
<h2 id="certain-rsvfp-expenditures-business-enterprise-program-bep">Certain RSVFP expenditures (Business Enterprise Program (BEP))</h2>
<p>In many States, the RSVFP is commonly known as the “Business Enterprise Program” or “BEP.”
Although the RSVFP is authorized under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, Section 103(b)(1) of the
Rehabilitation Act creates a nexus between the VR program and RSVFP. In so doing, Congress
authorized the VR program to use Title I VR funds to cover many of the costs incurred in
establishing vending facilities and purchasing equipment under the RSVFP. Therefore, the VR
program requirements must be read in conjunction with those under the Randolph-Sheppard Act
to give meaning to both.</p>
<p>Specifically, Section 103(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 C.F.R. § 361.49(a)(5) permit the
VR agencies to use Federal funds for small business enterprises, including those established
under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, for the provision of—</p>
<p>5</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  The management and supervision provided by the VR agency;</li>
<li>•  Acquisition by the State agency of vending facilities or other equipment;</li>
<li>•  Initial stocks and supplies; and</li>
<li>•  Initial operating expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The VR agency that serves individuals who are blind or visually impaired also is the State
licensing agency (SLA) for the RSVFP. The SLA is authorized to issue licenses to blind
individuals to operate vending facilities on Federal and other properties and administers the</p>
<h2 id="states-rsvfp-34-cfr-3951v">State’s RSVFP (34 C.F.R. § 395.1(v)).</h2>
<p>In addition to the above activities specifically identified in the Rehabilitation Act and its
implementing regulations for the benefit of the RSVFP, the VR agency also may use Federal VR
funds to pay for the costs of maintenance associated with the vending facilities and equipment,
consistent with the requirements given to all Federal grantees by 2 C.F.R. § 200.452 and
longstanding RSA policy.</p>
<p>As is true with any VR program activity, these VR costs incurred for the benefit of the RSVFP
may be paid with Federal VR grant funds or non-Federal funds used for match purposes under
the VR program. The three most common sources of non-Federal funds used for match purposes
for expenditures incurred under the VR program for the benefit of the RSVFP are—</p>
<ul>
<li>•  State-appropriated funds (discussed previously in this TAC);</li>
<li>
<p>•  RSVFP unassigned Federal vending machine income; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>•  RSVFP set-aside funds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rsvfp-unassigned-federal-vending-machine-income-and-rsvfp-set-aside-funds">RSVFP Unassigned Federal Vending Machine Income and RSVFP Set-Aside Funds</h2>
<p>Unassigned Federal vending machine income, for purposes of the RSVFP, is that income from
vending machines on Federal property that accrues to the SLA from a property management
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States in accordance with 34 C.F.R.
§ 395.32 (34 C.F.R. §§ 395.1 and 395.8(a)).</p>
<p>Regulations implementing the Randolph-Sheppard Act at 34 C.F.R. § 395.1(s) define “set-aside
funds” as funds that accrue to the SLA from an assessment against the net proceeds of each
vending facility in the State’s vending facility program and any income from vending machines
on Federal property that accrues to the SLA.</p>
<p>The RSVFP regulations at 34 C.F.R. §§ 395.8(c) and 395.9(b) authorize many different uses for</p>
<p>the unassigned Federal vending machine income and set-aside funds, respectively; however, only
the following RSVFP expenditures, which are also allowable under the VR program, may be
used for match purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>•  Maintenance and replacement of equipment;</li>
<li>•  Purchase of new equipment; and</li>
<li>•  Management services.</li>
</ul>
<p>6</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<p>Therefore, any allowable expenditures incurred for these purposes with RSVFP unassigned
Federal vending machine income or set-aside funds may be used toward the VR program match
requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>B.   Considerations When Determining Use of Other Sources for Non-Federal Match</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sources-other-than-state-appropriations">Sources Other than State Appropriations</h2>
<p>While other sources of match may involve State or local public funds (i.e., TPCAs and
interagency transfers), establishment projects may include local or private funds, depending on
the nature of the CRP (i.e., whether it is a public or private nonprofit CRP).</p>
<p>When considering the use of TPCAs as a source of match, VR agencies should be aware that the</p>
<p>implementation of an order of selection by a VR agency can affect the availability and provision
of services provided under a TPCA for eligible individuals with disabilities who are placed in a
closed category on a waiting list for services. However, students with disabilities receiving
pre-employment transition services under a TPCA while potentially eligible for the VR program
may continue to receive pre-employment transition services after an eligibility determination that
places them on a waiting list.</p>
<p>Some VR agencies rely upon TPCAs to obtain a significant portion of the required non-Federal
share for the VR program due to the lack of State-appropriated funds for the program. However,
cooperating agencies experiencing budgetary changes may be limited in their ability to continue
participating in these arrangements or to serve adequate numbers of individuals with disabilities.
These changes can affect or reduce the level of non-Federal funds available for match and,
consequently, the amount of Federal funds available for use in the VR program.</p>
<p>Funding constraints resulting from decreases in State appropriations or budgetary fluctuations
also may affect the ability of another State or local agency to transfer non-Federal funds, which</p>
<p>may be used to satisfy match requirements under the VR program, to a VR agency. For this
reason, VR agencies may not be able to rely consistently on interagency transfers from other
agencies as a source of non-Federal share.</p>
<p>In addition, reliance on interagency transfers for significant amounts of the non-Federal share
can raise some of the same issues associated with TPCAs. For instance, the implementation of an
order of selection could dictate that too few of the transferring agency’s population would be
able to receive VR services through the program, thus making the continuation of such transfers
less attractive to the transferring agency. Also, other agencies may find interagency transfers
somewhat limiting or inadequate for their intended purposes, since the VR agency must retain
sole responsibility for determining eligibility for the individuals served, the services they would
receive, and the expenditure and allocation of all funds (34 C.F.R. § 361.13(c)).</p>
<p>When considering the use of establishment projects for non-Federal match, VR agencies are
reminded that the use of VR program funds is limited to—</p>
<p>7</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  Establishing a CRP’s facility with additional limitations imposed regarding the
square footage and size, appraised value, and other aspects of the facility (34 C.F.R.
§§ 361.5(c)(16)(i) and (17));</li>
<li>•  Building the staff capacity of a CRP for a maximum period of four years, with Federal
financial participation available at the applicable matching rate of 78.7 percent, applied to
a declining range of 100 percent of staffing costs in the first year to 45 percent in the
fourth and final year (34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(16)(ii)); and</li>
<li>•  Other expenditures that are necessary to make the CRP “functional or increase its
effectiveness in providing [VR] services… but are not ongoing operating expenses of the</li>
</ul>
<p>program” (34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(16)(iii)).</p>
<p>The utility of this mechanism for the purpose of obtaining non-Federal matching funds is
limited for some of the same reasons described above in connection with TPCAs. CRPs may not
possess the financial ability to provide the expected level of non-Federal share. In addition, VR
agencies may not be able to use the establishment authority to address a loss of non-Federal
share from other sources in a timely manner, if they have not engaged in the necessary planning
activities or have yet to adopt written policies governing the nature and scope of establishment
projects, both of which can take considerable time to complete. Furthermore, establishment
projects may not be well suited as a long-term source of non-Federal match, because they are
inherently short-term in nature, and should last only as long as it takes to complete program
development, construction, and (when applicable) the maximum four years of staffing support.</p>
<h2 id="non-federal-expenditures">Non-Federal Expenditures</h2>
<p>The receipt of non-Federal share (e.g., appropriations, interagency transfers) does not in itself
constitute match under the VR program. The funds must be expended for a VR service, as that</p>
<p>term is defined at 34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(57), or an administrative cost, as that term is defined at</p>
<h2 id="34-cfr-3615c2-34-cfr-3613-to-be-an-allowable-expenditure-under-the-vr">34 C.F.R. § 361.5(c)(2) (34 C.F.R. § 361.3). To be an allowable expenditure under the VR</h2>
<p>services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan, all VR program requirements, as
applicable, must be satisfied. This includes the requirements governing the non-delegable
functions of the DSU related to the determination of eligibility, the provision of services, and the
expenditure and allocation of funds (34 C.F.R. § 361.13(c)). The services also must be available
statewide in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 361.25.</p>
<p>VR expenditures counted and reported as non-Federal share must be incurred during the Federal
fiscal year (FFY) of appropriation (i.e., the FFY in which the grant was awarded). Obligations
may only be counted and reported as non-Federal share when obligated in the FFY of
appropriation of an award (i.e., by September 30 of the FFY in which the grant was awarded)
and liquidated by the end of the liquidation period for the award (i.e., within 120 days of the end
of the period of performance for that grant award). Non-Federal obligations that are cancelled
during the carryover period, if applicable, or otherwise not liquidated after the FFY of
appropriation, may not be used toward satisfying the match requirement. Therefore, any Federal</p>
<p>VR funds carried over on the basis of those obligations for use in the subsequent year, pursuant

<h2 id="certified-time-as-non-federal-share">Certified Time as Non-Federal Share</h2>
<p>As previously noted, a VR agency may enter TPCAs under 34 C.F.R. § 361.28 for providing VR
services with another State or local public agency that is furnishing part or all of the non-Federal
share under the program. If the third party is contributing funds to provide VR services, those
dollars may be used as part of the VR agency’s non-Federal share once expended (e.g., staff
salaries paid by the third party that are allowable matching expenditures). If, on the other hand,
the VR agency enters an arrangement under which a third party provides access to its equipment
or property in the administration of the VR program, the costs associated with those items cannot
be used as non-Federal share because in-kind expenditures are not permitted as match.</p>
<p>Certified expenditures for staff time under TPCAs are not considered in-kind contributions. To
be counted as non-Federal share, certified expenditures for staff time must be incurred for VR</p>
<p>purposes before they can be considered match. Therefore, certified expenditures for staff time
are only considered match after the staff time in support of the TPCA has been worked and
certified. Certified expenditures for staff time, absent a TPCA, would not be an allowable source
of match. In contrast, space, equipment, and other property (e.g., supplies) would be considered
third-party in-kind contributions and would not be allowable as match under the VR program
unless, for example, supplies were specifically purchased for use in the provision of direct
services during the time in which the TPCA was effective (34 C.F.R. § 361.28(c)(3)).</p>
<h2 id="reversion-to-donor-for-private-contributions">Reversion to Donor for Private Contributions</h2>
<p>If a business provides funds directly to the VR agency for use as match for the VR program,
pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 361.60(b)(3)(iii), regarding contributions by private entities, the
prohibition against reversion to donor is triggered. This means the VR agency would not be
permitted to pay the business directly for services provided to VR program participants unless
the business was paid through a contract that was implemented under the State’s regular
competitive procurement procedures, even if the VR agency is typically exempt from some or all</p>
<p>of those procedures.</p>
<h1 id="summary">SUMMARY:</h1>
<p>The information presented in this guidance is intended to encourage VR agencies to minimize
the return of and maximize the use and expenditure of available Federal VR program funds
through the understanding and exploration of the various allowable sources of non-Federal
match. Certain advantages are inherent in the use of State-appropriated match for the VR
programs, chief among them being the flexibility VR agencies possess in the way these funds
can be used to support the administrative and service-related costs of the program. VR agencies
may also give thoughtful and strategic consideration to the use of other allowable sources of
non-Federal match to maximize their ability to expend all available Federal funds to serve
individuals with disabilities. When pursuing other sources of non-Federal match, VR agencies
must meet specific requirements pertaining to various sources of match, including TPCAs,
establishment projects, and interagency transfers. The use of sources of match other than State
appropriations can affect the availability of VR program funding, both on the State and Federal</p>
<p>levels, as these methods of service provision may be affected by circumstances experienced by</p>

<p>other public and nonprofit agencies, resulting in fluctuations in or withdrawal of their
participation with the VR program. Above all, when considering how or whether to engage in
these activities to increase non-Federal match, VR agencies should determine that they are of
sound programmatic benefit to the individuals with disabilities served through the VR program.</p>
