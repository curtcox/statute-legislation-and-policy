<p>RSA uses the SF-425 data to monitor the financial status of the VR

contained in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as
amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).</p>

<h2 id="therefore-the-reports-must-be-accurate-and-submitted-timely-vr">Therefore, the reports must be accurate and submitted timely. VR</h2>
<p>grantees must submit completed SF-425 reports on a semi-annual basis.
The end dates for each reporting period in a fiscal year are 3/31 and 9/30.
Semi-annual reports must be submitted no later than 45 days1 after the end
of the reporting period. Final reports must be submitted no later than 90
days after the period of performance. Period of performance means the
time during which the non-Federal entity may incur new obligations to
carry out the work authorized under the Federal award.</p>
<p>Obligations made during the period of performance may be liquidated at
any point during the liquidation period, which is 90 days after the period
of performance. If, however, the timing of liquidating obligations
precludes submission of the final SF-425 within 90 days of the period of</p>
<p>performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request in accordance
with the Department of Education’s Policy Memorandum regarding
extension of liquidation periods. If the late liquidation request is
approved, the grantee must submit the final SF-425 after the funds have
been liquidated, but no later than 45 days after the end of the extension
period.</p>
<h2 id="electronic-submission">Electronic Submission</h2>
<h2 id="reports-must-be-submitted-electronically-through-the-rsa-website-by">Reports must be submitted electronically through the RSA website. By</h2>
<p>certifying the report, the grantee is certifying that it is aware that any false,
fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact,
may subject them to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud,
false statements, false claims or otherwise (2 CFR 200.415).</p>

<h2 id="sf-425-form-state-vr-services-program-reporting-instructions">SF-425 Form: State VR Services Program Reporting Instructions</h2>
<p>While the SF-425 report is designed for single grant and multiple grant award reporting, the U.S.
Department of Education’s (Department’s) policy is that multiple grant award reporting is not
permitted for Department grants. The SF-425 attachment (SF-425A), which is to be used for
reporting multiple grants, is not to be used for Department grants and is not included with this</p>
<p>PD. As such, references to multiple grant reporting and to the SF-425A in items 2, 5 and 10 of
the SF-425 are not applicable to Department grantees. The Department requires grantees to
complete a separate SF-425 for each grant they receive.</p>
<h2 id="1-federal-agency-and-organizational-element-to-which-report-is-submitted">1. Federal Agency and Organizational Element to Which Report is Submitted:</h2>
<p>Data entry is not required for this field. RSA is the default entry.</p>
<h2 id="2-federal-grant-or-other-identifying-number-assigned-by-federal-agency">2. Federal Grant or Other Identifying Number Assigned by Federal Agency:</h2>
<p>Data entry is not required for this field. The grantee’s grant award number is the default
entry. This is the Award Number listed in Box 2 of the Grant Award Notification (GAN).
The grant award number is also referred to as the Federal Award Identification Number
(FAIN). If the information on the form is not correct, please notify the RSA Fiscal Unit
contact for your award.</p>
<h2 id="3-recipient-organization">3. Recipient Organization:</h2>
<p>Data entry is not required for this field. The organization’s name and address associated</p>
<p>with the grant will be the default entry. This is the organization information listed in Box 1
of the GAN. If the information on the form is not correct, please notify the RSA Fiscal Unit
contact for your award.</p>
<p>4a. DUNS Number:
Data entry is not required for this field. The Grantee Data Universal Numbering System
- (DUNS) number associated with the grant will be the default entry. This is the DUNS
number listed in Box 8 of the GAN. If the information on the form is not correct, please
notify the RSA Fiscal Unit contact for your award.</p>
<p>4b. EIN:
Data entry is not required for this field. The Employer Identification Number (EIN)
associated with the grantee will be the default entry. This number is also known as the Tax

<h2 id="5-recipient-account-number-or-identifying-number">5. Recipient Account Number or Identifying Number:</h2>
<p>This is an optional data element. Enter an account number or any other identifying number
assigned by the grantee to the award. This number is for the grantee’s use only and is not
required by RSA. Data entry is limited to 30 characters.</p>
<h2 id="6-report-type">6. Report Type:</h2>
<p>Indicate if report is final. A report can be marked as final at the end of the period of
performance if the grantee has liquidated its obligations and no additional reporting is</p>
<p>7</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<p>required for the grant award. The final report must indicate that Federal and non-Federal
funds have been liquidated. There must be no cash on hand, all obligations must be
liquidated, and program income must be disbursed.</p>
<h2 id="7-basis-of-accounting-cashaccrual">7. Basis of Accounting (Cash/Accrual):</h2>
<p>Specify whether a cash or accrual basis was used for recording transactions related to the
grant award and for preparing the SF-425. For cash basis accounting, expenses are recorded
when they are paid. Accrual basis of accounting refers to the accounting method where
expenses are reported when incurred. Accrued expenditures are recorded when goods or
services are received, regardless of when cash is received or paid. To report accrual
information, the grantee is not required to convert its accounting system to the accrual basis,
but shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on
hand (2 CFR 200.302 and 200.327).</p>
<p>Note: A grantee can report using either a cash or accrual basis of accounting. However, if a
grantee changes from one basis to another, the grantee should inform RSA of the change.
To ensure grantees are not utilizing separate bases of accounting for awards covering the
same timeframe, changes should coincide with the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<h2 id="8-projectgrant-period-fromto">8. Project/Grant Period (From/To):</h2>
<p>Data entry is not required for this field. The grant period will be entered by default and will
be the same as Box 6 on the GAN that documents when Federal sponsorship begins and
ends. The grant period represents the period for which the funds were awarded in
accordance with 34 CFR 77.1. The grant period is one year. However, Federal funds
which remain unobligated at the end of the year of appropriation may be carried over for
obligation in the succeeding fiscal year only to the extent that the agency complied with the
matching requirement applicable to the State VR Services program for the fiscal year for
which the funds were appropriated (Section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act and 34 CFR
361.64(b)).</p>
<h2 id="9-reporting-period-end-date">9. Reporting Period End Date:</h2>
<p>Data entry may be required for this field if the grantee is submitting a final report. The
reporting period end date entered by default will correspond with the required reporting
period (3/31 and 9/30). The period covered is always the beginning date of the grant
through the end of the reporting period. When submitting a final SF-425 form:
- • if all funds are obligated by 9/30 of the fiscal year in which the award was made and
liquidated within 90 days, the reporting period end date shall be 9/30 of the fiscal year in
which the award was made;
- • if Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year, and all funds
are obligated by either 3/31 or 9/30 of the carryover year and liquidated within 90 days,
the reporting period end date for the final report shall be 9/30 of the carryover year; and
- • if Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year, a late</p>
<p>liquidation request extension has been approved, and funds were obligated by 9/30 of the
carryover year and liquidated by the approved date for late liquidation, the reporting
period end date for the final report shall remain 9/30 of the carryover year, but the final</p>
<p>8</p>

<h2 id="page-9">Page 9</h2>
<p>report shall be due 45 days after the end date of the approved late liquidation extension
period.</p>
<h2 id="10-transactions_1">10. Transactions</h2>
<p>10a. Federal Cash Receipts:
The grantee must enter the net amount of Federal VR funds on line 10a that the
grantee has drawn down from G5. This amount is obtained by running a G5 External</p>
<h2 id="award-activity-report-httpswwwg5gov-using-date-parameters">Award Activity Report (https://www.g5.gov) using date parameters.</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  For semi-annual reports, the date parameters will be the start date of the award
and the reporting period end date.</li>
<li>•  For final reports, the date parameters will be the start date of the award and the</li>
</ul>
<p>date award funds were liquidated.
The net amount of Federal VR funds drawn down will be shown on the G5 report and
should be entered as the amount on line 10a of the SF-425 form. Grantees may want
to maintain copies of the G5 External Award Activity Reports as supporting
documentation that verifies the accuracy of the amount reported on line 10a.</p>
<p>10b. Federal Cash Disbursements:
Enter the cumulative amount of actual disbursements made from Federal VR funds
drawn down during the reporting period. Disbursements are the sum of actual cash
expenditures made for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect
expenses charged to the award, and the amount of cash advances and payments made
to contractors/vendors.</p>
<p>10c. Federal Cash on Hand (10a minus 10b equals 10c):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.</p>
<p>If more than three business days of cash are on hand, RSA requires an explanation on
line 12, Remarks, explaining why the drawdown was made prematurely or other
reasons for the excess cash. Grantees must minimize the time elapsing between
drawdown of Federal funds and disbursement by the grantee in accordance with</p>
<h2 id="federal-regulations-31-cfr-part-205-and-2-cfr-200305b">Federal regulations (31 CFR part 205 and 2 CFR 200.305(b)).</h2>
<p>10d. Total Federal Funds Authorized:
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is updated automatically
and represents the total amount of Federal funds awarded to the grantee as of the end
of the reporting period.</p>
<p>10e. Federal Share of Expenditures:
Enter the amount of expenditures incurred with Federal funds (also known as Federal
fund expenditures).
- •  For reports prepared on a cash basis, the agency should report Federal fund</p>
<p>expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and
services, the amount of indirect expenses charged, and the amount of payments
made to contractors/vendors.</p>
<p>9</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-10">Page 10</h2>
<ul>
<li>•  For reports prepared on an accrual basis, grantees should report Federal fund
expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and
services, the amount of indirect expenses incurred, the amount of payments made
to contractors/vendors, and the increase or decrease in the amounts owed by the
recipient for goods received and services performed by employees,
contractors/vendors, and other payees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not include Federal program income received by the grantee on line 10e. See line
10l for instructions regarding the reporting of Federal program income.</p>
<p>Grantees must include all Federal VR fund expenditures incurred under the VR
program on line 10e, including Federal expenditures incurred for the provision of pre-</p>
<p>employment transition services. The amount expended on pre-employment transition
services, included on line 10e, must also be reported separately in Section 12, line
12b – Remarks.</p>
<p>10f. Federal Share of Unliquidated Obligations:
Enter the Federal portion of unliquidated obligations incurred by the grantee.
Unliquidated obligations include direct and indirect expenses for goods and services
incurred by the grantee, but not yet paid or charged to the VR grant award, including
amounts due to contractors/vendors. When submitting a final SF-425 report, this line
should be zero.</p>
<h2 id="on-line-10f-do-not-include">On line 10f, do not include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>expenditures reported on line 10e; and</li>

<li>future fund commitments (e.g., a long term contract) for which an obligation or
expense has not been incurred pursuant to 34 CFR 76.707.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Grantees have 90 days from the end of the period of performance to liquidate
Federal obligations (2 CFR 200.328(b)(1)), which applies regardless of whether the
grantee uses a cash or accrual basis of accounting. If the timing of liquidating
obligations precludes submission of the final SF-425 report within 90 days after the
period of performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request. The request
for late liquidation must be made in accordance with the Department’s guidance on
late liquidations. If approved, the grantee must liquidate the approved obligations and
submit the final SF-425 report within 45 days after the approved late liquidation
extension date. When submitting a final SF-425 report, line 10f should be zero.</p>
<p>10g. Total Federal Share (sum of 10e and 10f equals 10g):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.</p>
<p>10h. Unobligated Balance of Federal Funds (10d minus 10g equals 10h):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
For the final report, this represents the amount of Federal VR funds awarded that the</p>
<p>grantee did not request or draw down.</p>
<p>10</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-11">Page 11</h2>
<p>10i. Total Recipient Share Required:
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically
using the following formula, and reflects the 21.3 percent match requirement: (line
10a divided by 0.787) multiplied by (0.213).</p>
<p>10j. Recipient Share of Expenditures:
Enter the total amount of non-Federal VR expenditures incurred for the reporting
period. This amount must include the grantee’s non-Federal share of actual cash
disbursements or outlays (less any rebates, refunds, or other credits), including
payments to contractors, the grantee’s non-Federal share of unliquidated obligations
(reported separately on line 12d – Remarks), and the Non-Federal Share of</p>
<h2 id="expenditures-for-the-establishment-or-construction-of-facilities-for-community">Expenditures for the Establishment or Construction of Facilities for Community</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation Program (CRP) Purposes as reported on line 12a. The amount</p>
<p>reported on line 10j does not include Federal program income earned by the grantee.
See line 10l for instructions regarding the reporting of Federal program income.</p>
<p>The amount reported on line 10j should be equal to or greater than the amount
reported on 10i (required non-Federal share amount) to ensure Federal funds are
being drawn down proportionally in accordance with the Cash Management
Improvement Act (CMIA) (31 CFR 205.15(d)). By 9/30 of the fiscal year in which
the award was made, the grantee must have provided the requisite non-Federal share
for any Federal VR funds that will be carried over for obligation in the succeeding
fiscal year, in addition to the non-Federal share required for Federal VR funds that
have been obligated or expended by 9/30 of the fiscal year in which the VR award
was made.</p>
<p>10k. Remaining Recipient Share to Be Provided (10i minus 10j equals 10k):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
If the amount is a positive number, this figure represents the amount of non-Federal</p>
<p>share the grantee was required to provide, but did not, by the end of grant period. If
the amount is a negative number, this figure represents the amount of non-Federal
share provided by the grantee that exceeds the non-Federal share required based upon
the amount of Federal funds drawn down. Grantees must ensure Federal funds are
drawn down proportionally in accordance with the CMIA (31 CFR 205.15(d)) (2</p>
<h2 id="cfr-200305b">CFR 200.305(b)).</h2>
<p>10l. Total Federal Program Income Earned:
Enter the total amount of Federal program income (program income) earned and
received by the grantee as of the end of the reporting period. Program income is
considered earned in the fiscal year in which the funds are received by the grantee
(34 CFR 361.63 and 2 CFR 200.80). Therefore, the amount reported on line 10l
should not change after the grantee submits its fourth quarter SF-425 report.</p>
<p>11</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-12">Page 12</h2>
<p>Program income means gross income received by the grantee that is directly
generated by an allowable activity supported under the VR program to VR applicants
or consumers (2 CFR 200.307). Sources of program income include, but are not
limited to: payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA) for assisting</p>
<h2 id="social-security-beneficiaries-and-recipients-to-achieve-employment-outcomes">Social Security beneficiaries and recipients to achieve employment outcomes,</h2>
<p>payments received from workers' compensation funds, fees for services to defray part
or all of the costs of services provided to VR applicants and consumers, income
generated by a State-operated CRP for services to VR applicants and consumers,
consumer financial contributions resulting from financial means tests, and payments
or reimbursements from insurers for consumer services. Do not include refunds or
rebates as program income.</p>
<p>Note: A VR grantee may choose to use SSA payments earned by the VR program for</p>
<p>eligible formula grant programs funded under the Rehabilitation Act (Section 108 of
Rehabilitation Act and 34 CFR 361.63(c)(2)). The flexibility to transfer program
income received from SSA in accordance with 34 CFR 361.63(c)(2) is not granted to
the VR agency with regard to program income earned from other sources. Each
program earning, or receiving for its use, SSA payments must report the funds as
program income earned or received on line 10l. For example, if the VR program
receives $100,000 in SSA payments and keeps it for its own program use, the VR
grantee must include the $100,000 on line 10l. However, if the VR program receives
$100,000 in SSA payments, but transfers the entire amount to the Independent Living
for Older Individuals who are Blind (OIB) program, both the VR and OIB programs
must report the $100,000 on line 10l of their respective SF-425s. In so doing, the VR
program would report that the funds were “expended” by reporting the transfer on
line 10n – Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Addition Alternative
and would also report the transfer of program income to the OIB program on line 12f
– Remarks. In addition, in this example, the OIB program would report the program
income on line 10l as received and report the program income as transferred from the</p>
<p>VR program in the Remarks section on line 12b – Remarks of its own SF-425.</p>
<p>Program income from SSA payments recorded as received in the VR program and
transferred to an eligible receiving program is considered expended in the VR
program. Include the amount of SSA payments transferred on line 10n; additionally,
include that amount under the correct line in Section 12 – Remarks that corresponds
to the eligible program receiving the transferred VR SSA payments. Program income
from SSA payments transferred to other eligible programs is restricted to the grant
award year that corresponds to the fiscal year in which it was earned in the VR
program. For example, SSA payments earned in the VR program in FY 2015 may be
transferred to the FY 2015 OIB program at any time during the period of performance
of the FY 2015 award.</p>
<p>Program income earned may be expended in accordance with the deduction or
addition alternative.</p>
<p>12</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-13">Page 13</h2>
<p>10m. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Deduction Alternative:
For those grantees using the deduction alternative, enter the amount of program
income that was used to reduce the Federal share of the total VR program costs. This
reporting alternative is available to the grantee agency even though the use of the
addition alternative is also authorized under the VR program (34 CFR 361.63(c)(3)).
The grantee must expend program income funds in accordance with the same
standards of allowability, reasonableness and allocability (2 CFR 200.403, 200.404
and 200.405) that are applicable to Federal funds (Section 108 of the Rehabilitation
Act and 34 CFR 361.63(c)(3); and 2 CFR 200.307(e)(1), 200.401, and 200.408). Be
advised that if a grantee utilizes the deduction alternative, the amount of program
income entered will reduce the Federal share, which will result in the return of these
funds to the Department.</p>
<p>10n. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Addition Alternative:
For those grantees using the addition alternative, enter the amount of program income
that was used to supplement the Federal share of the total program costs. The amount
reported on line 10n represents actual disbursements (i.e., outlays of program income
by the grantee). The outlay of program income funds must meet the same standards
of allowability, reasonableness and allocability (2 CFR 200.403, 200.404 and
200.405) that are applicable to Federal funds (Section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act
and 34 CFR 361.63(c)(3); and 2 CFR 200.307(e)(2), 200.401, and 200.408).</p>
<p>10o. Unexpended Program Income (10l minus 10m or 10n equals 10o):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
When submitting a final SF-425 report, this line should be zero. Program income that
has not been disbursed by the end of the liquidation period must be returned to the</p>

recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash
payments.” [emphasis added]</p>
<h2 id="11-indirect-expense_1">11. Indirect Expense:</h2>
<p>Indirect costs are generally charged to Federal awards via an indirect cost rate. Any grantee
that wishes to claim indirect costs under Department awards must prepare an indirect cost
proposal and submit it to the cognizant Federal agency for approval (2 CFR part 200 –
Appendix VII, paragraph D). Grantees claiming indirect expenses based on an approved
cost allocation plan (CAP) (2 CFR part 200 – Appendix VII, paragraph F.3, rather than an
indirect cost rate, should follow the directions included in the line item instructions below).</p>
<p>11a. Type of Rate(s):

Enter the beginning and ending effective dates for the approved indirect cost rate(s)
or CAP.</p>
<p>11d. Base:
Enter the amount of the base against which the approved indirect cost rate(s) was
applied. The base includes allowable expenditures to which the approved indirect
cost rate may be applied. For CAPs, enter the total amount of the CAP costs (include
both non-Federal and Federal).</p>

<p>This section is used to report data elements unique to the VR program that are necessary to
ensure compliance with program requirements. This section can also be used, as needed, to
clarify and explain amounts reported, including sources of matching funds, and changes
from amounts previously reported.</p>
<p>12a. Non-Federal Share of Expenditures for the Establishment or Construction of Facilities
for Community Rehabilitation Program Purposes:
Enter the non-Federal share of expenditures, also included in the total amount of non-
Federal expenditures reported on line 10j, incurred for the establishment or
construction of facilities for CRP purposes (34 CFR 361.62(b)). Only include those
costs for activities that would meet the definition of “establishment of a facility for a
community rehabilitation program” at 34 CFR 361.5(b)(18) and “construction of a
community rehabilitation program” at 34 CFR 361.5(b)(12). Do not include staffing
costs or other costs associated with establishment projects, such as those additional
costs included in the definition of “establishment of a community rehabilitation
program” at 34 CFR 361.5(b)(17). If no funds were used for this purpose during the
reporting period, enter zero on this line. Do not include Federal funds used for this
purpose.</p>

<h2 id="page-15">Page 15</h2>
<p>12b. Pre-Employment Transition Services:
Enter the total amount of Federal expenditures incurred for the provision of pre-
employment transition services to individuals eligible to receive such services (i.e.,
students with disabilities). Only include Federal funds that were used to pay for
activities that are authorized under Section 113 of the Rehabilitation Act. Agencies
are required to reserve not less than 15 percent of the total Federal VR allotment,
received under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act, for the provision of pre-
