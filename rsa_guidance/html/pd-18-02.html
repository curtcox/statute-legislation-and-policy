<p>services, for youth with the most significant disabilities (CFDA 84.187B).</p>
<h1 id="policy">POLICY</h1>
<p>STATEMENT:     The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires that grantees use
the SF-425 to report financial data for grant awards. Through this Policy</p>
<h2 id="directive-pd-the-rehabilitation-services-administration-rsa-is">Directive (PD), the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) is</h2>

<p>12, 2015. Given the issuance of two separate Supported Employment grant
awards beginning in Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2018—necessary for States
to accurately report the 10 percent non-Federal share required to match
funds reserved for the provision of supported employment services,
including extended services, to youth with the most significant disabilities
(34 C.F.R. § 363.22)—RSA has determined it necessary to develop
separate sets of SF-425 instructions specific to the two separate Supported
Employment grant awards, transmitted in this PD and in PD-18-01 for the</p>
<h2 id="supported-employment-program-for-all-eligible-individuals-34-cfr">Supported Employment program for all eligible individuals (34 C.F.R.</h2>

<p>as this method is no longer an option for expending program

clarify that program income must be disbursed within the period of
performance of the award, prior to requesting additional Federal
cash draws from the Supported Employment award (34 C.F.R.

<hr />
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p>Grantees must submit completed SF-425 reports on an annual basis. The
end date for the reporting period is September 30. Annual reports must be
submitted no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. Final
reports must be submitted no later than 90 days after the period of
performance. The period of performance is the time during which the non-
Federal entity may incur new obligations to carry out the work authorized
under the Federal award.</p>
<p>Obligations made during the period of performance may be liquidated at any
point during the liquidation period, which ends 90 days after the period of
performance. If, however, the timing of liquidating obligations precludes
submission of the final SF-425 within 90 days following the period of
performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request in accordance</p>
<p>with the Department of Education’s Policy Memorandum regarding
extension of liquidation periods. If the late liquidation request is approved,
the grantee must submit the final SF-425 after the funds have been
liquidated, but no later than 30 days after the end of the extension period.</p>
<p>Agencies are responsible for having internal controls necessary to ensure the
SF-425 data is accurate and reliable upon submission to RSA. Agencies may
request, through the RSA management information system, that a SF-425
report be opened for revision. The RSA Financial Management Specialist
assigned to the agency will review the request and, if necessary, place the
form in an edit status to permit changes.</p>
<h2 id="electronic-submission">Electronic Submission</h2>
<p>Reports must be submitted electronically through the RSA website. As is
done for other reports submitted to RSA electronically, grantees should</p>
<p>maintain a hardcopy of the report for verification purposes, signed by the
certifying official who is authorized to legally bind the non-Federal entity.
By certifying the report, the grantee is certifying that it is aware that any
false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material
fact, may subject them to “criminal, civil or administrative penalties for
fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise” (2 C.F.R. § 200.415).</p>

<p>While the SF-425 report is designed for single grant and multiple grant award reporting, the U.S.
Department of Education’s (Department) policy is that multiple grant award reporting is not
permitted for Department grants. The SF-425 attachment (SF-425A), which is to be used for</p>
<p>reporting multiple grants, is not to be used for Department grants and is not included with this
PD. As such, references to multiple grant reporting and to the SF-425A in items 2, 5 and 10 of
the SF-425 are not applicable to Department grantees. The Department requires grantees to
complete a separate SF-425 for each grant they receive.</p>

<p>Indicate if the report is final. A report can be marked as final prior to the end of the period of
performance if the grantee has liquidated its obligations and no additional reporting is
required for the grant award. The final report must indicate that Federal obligations have
been liquidated. There should be no cash on hand and program income must be disbursed.</p>
<h2 id="7-basis-of-accounting-cashaccrual">7. Basis of Accounting (Cash/Accrual):</h2>
<p>Specify whether a cash or accrual basis was used for recording transactions related to the
grant award and for preparing the SF-425. For cash basis accounting, expenses are recorded
when they are paid. Accrual basis of accounting refers to the accounting method where
expenses are reported when incurred. Accrued expenditures are recorded when goods or
services are received, regardless of when cash is received or paid.</p>
<p>Note: A grantee can report using either a cash or accrual basis of accounting. However, if a
grantee changes from one basis to another, the grantee should inform RSA of the change.

<h2 id="8-projectgrant-period-fromto">8. Project/Grant Period (From/To):</h2>
<p>Data entry is not required for this field. The grant period will be entered by default and will
be the same as Box 6 on the GAN that documents when Federal sponsorship begins and
ends. This data element represents the period for which the funds were awarded (34 C.F.R.
§ 77.1(c)). The Uniform Guidance uses the term “period of performance” rather than “grant
period.” Period of performance is defined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.77 in a manner similar to the
Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) definition of “grant
period.” The grant period represents the period for which the funds were awarded in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 77.1. The grant period is one year. However, Federal funds
that remain unobligated at the end of the year of appropriation under CFDA 84.187A and
CFDA 84.187B may be carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY (Section 19 of the</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Act, and 34 C.F.R. § 76.709) only to the extent that the agency complied with
the applicable matching requirement for the Supported Employment award (CFDA
84.187B) (the 10 percent match requirement for the funds reserved for the provision of
Supported Employment services, including extended services, to youth with the most
significant disabilities) for the FFY in which the funds were awarded (sections 19 and
606(b)(7)(I) of the Rehabilitation Act, 34 C.F.R. § 363.23(a)(2) and 34 C.F.R. § 76.709).</p>
<p>During the FFY of appropriation, the Federal Funding Period listed in Box 6 of the GAN
will be from October 1 to September 30 of that FFY. This represents the one-year period for
which the award is made and in which the grantee may incur new obligations against the
award. Section 19(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act permits grantees to carry over Federal
funds for obligation and expenditure in the subsequent FFY provided certain conditions are
met. Upon submission of the grantee’s fourth quarter SF-425s (which is the reporting period
ending September 30 of the FFY of appropriation) for both Supported Employment awards,
an RSA Financial Management Specialist will review the grantee’s reports to determine
whether the grantee met requirements to carry over funds under the Supported Employment
award reserved for youth with most significant disabilities (CFDA 84.187B). In the event</p>
<p>9</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="page-10">Page 10</h2>
<p>the grantee met the requirements of section 19 of the Rehabilitation Act to carry over funds
under CFDA 84.187B for an additional FFY. Additionally, RSA will extend the period of
performance for the CFDA 84.187A for an additional FFY if there is an unobligated balance
of Federal funds for CFDA 84.187A as of September 30 of the year of appropriation. If the
grantee does not meet the requirements to carry over Federal funds under CDFA 84.187B,
the CFDA 84.187A grant award will also not be permitted to carry over funds, regardless of
the amount of unobligated Federal funds that remain for CFDA 84.187A as of September 30
of the year of appropriation.</p>
<h2 id="9-reporting-period-end-date">9. Reporting Period End Date:</h2>
<p>Data entry may be required for this field if the grantee is submitting a final report. The
default reporting period end date will correspond with the required reporting period
(September 30). The period covered is always the beginning date of the grant through the</p>
<p>end of the reporting period. When submitting a final SF-425 form:
- • If all funds are obligated by September 30 of the FFY in which the award was made and
liquidated within 90 days after the end of that period, the reporting period end date shall
be September 30 of the FFY in which the award was made;
- • If Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY, all funds must be
obligated by September 30 of the carryover year and liquidated within 90 days following
the period of performance, the reporting period end date for the final report shall be</p>
<h2 id="september-30-of-the-carryover-year-and">September 30 of the carryover year; and</h2>
<ul>
<li>• If Federal funds are carried over for obligation in the succeeding FFY, a late liquidation
request extension has been approved, and funds were obligated by September 30 of the
carryover year and liquidated by the approved date for late liquidation, the reporting
period end date for the final report shall remain September 30 of the carryover year, but
the final report shall be due 30 days after the end date of the approved late liquidation</li>

<h2 id="10-transactions_1">10. Transactions</h2>
<p>10a. Federal Cash Receipts:
The grantee must enter the net drawdown amount on line 10a, which is obtained by
running a G5 External Award Activity Report (https://www.g5.gov) using date
parameters.
- •  For annual reports, the date parameters entered in G5 will be the start date of the
award and the reporting period end date.
- •  For final reports, the date parameters entered in G5 will be the start date of the
award and the date award funds were liquidated. Because an agency may draw
down funds during the liquidation period or upon receipt of an approved late
liquidation request, the end date of the G5 External Award Activity Report may</p>
<p>be past the end of the period of performance of the award. This does not change
the reporting period end date listed on the SF-425.</p>
<h2 id="the-federal-supported-employment-cfda-84187b-net-drawdown-amount-will">The Federal Supported Employment (CFDA 84.187B) net drawdown amount will</h2>

<p>youth with the most significant disabilities drawn down during the reporting period
from line 10a. Disbursements are the sum of actual cash expenditures made for direct

and the amount of cash advances and payments made to contractors/vendors.</p>
<p>10c. Federal Cash on Hand (10a minus 10b equals 10c):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.</p>
<p>If more than three business days of cash are on hand, RSA requires an explanation on
line 12, Remarks, explaining why the drawdown was made prematurely or other
reasons for the excess cash. Grantees must minimize the time elapsing between the
drawdown of Federal funds and disbursement by the grantee in accordance with</p>
<h2 id="federal-requirements-31-cfr-part-205-34-cfr-36324b1">Federal requirements (31 C.F.R. part 205; 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(1)).</h2>
<p>10d. Total Federal Funds Authorized:
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is updated automatically
and represents the total amount of Federal funds awarded to the grantee as of the end
of the reporting period.</p>
<p>10e. Federal Share of Expenditures:
Enter the amount of expenditures incurred with Federal funds (CFDA 84.187B) (also
known as Federal fund expenditures).
- •  For reports prepared on a cash basis, the agency should report Federal fund</p>
<p>expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and
services, the amount of indirect expenses charged, and the amount of payments
made to contractors/vendors.
- •  For reports prepared on an accrual basis, grantees should report Federal fund
expenditures as the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and
services, the amount of indirect expenses incurred, the amount of payments made
to contractors/vendors, and the increase or decrease in the amounts owed by the
recipient for goods received and services performed by employees,
contractors/vendors, and other payees.</p>

services, to youth with the most significant disabilities. Unliquidated obligations</p>

<p>include direct and indirect expenses for goods and services incurred by the grantee,
but not yet paid or charged to the Supported Employment grant award for services,
and extended services, to youth with the most significant disabilities, including
amounts due to contractors/vendors. When submitting a final SF-425 report, this line
should be zero.</p>
<h2 id="on-line-10f-do-not-include">On line 10f, do not include:</h2>

expense has not been incurred pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 76.707.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Grantees have 90 days from the end of the period of performance to liquidate
Federal obligations (2 C.F.R. § 200.328(b)(1)), which applies regardless of whether</p>
<p>the grantee uses a cash or accrual basis of accounting. If the timing of liquidating
obligations precludes submission of the final SF-425 report within 90 days after the
period of performance, grantees must submit a late liquidation request. The request
for late liquidation must be made in accordance with the Department’s guidance on
late liquidations. If approved, the grantee must liquidate the approved obligations and
submit the final SF-425 report within 30 days after the approved late liquidation
extension date. When submitting a final SF-425 report, line 10f should be zero.</p>
<p>10g. Total Federal Share (sum of 10e and 10f equals 10g):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.</p>
<p>10h. Unobligated Balance of Federal Funds (10d minus 10g equals 10h):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
For the final report, this represents the amount of Federal Supported Employment
program funds that the grantee did not obligate or liquidate.</p>
<p>10i. Total Recipient Share Required:
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically
using the following formula: ((10a divided by 0.90) multiplied by 0.10). The amount
calculated represents the non-Federal share required (10 percent) for the Supported
Employment services program, which is based upon the amount of cash drawdowns
from G5, identified in line 10a (Section 606(b)(7)(I) of the Rehabilitation Act and</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-total-amount-of-non-federal-expenditures-and-unliquidated-obligations">Enter the total amount of non-Federal expenditures and unliquidated obligations</h2>
<p>incurred for the reporting period. This amount must include the grantee’s non-Federal
share of actual cash disbursements or outlays (less any rebates, refunds, or other

unliquidated obligations (reported separately on line 12a - Recipient Share of</p>

<p>10j does not include Federal program income earned by the grantee. See line 10l for
instructions regarding reporting of Federal program income.</p>
<p>Grantees may visit the RSA website (https://rsa.ed.gov) and access the Match
Calculator to calculate the amount of non-Federal share required by September 30 of
the year of appropriation to match their authorized Federal funds (i.e., total Federal
award amount) or any unobligated portion of Federal funds the grantee intends to
carry over for obligation into the succeeding FFY.</p>
<p>To ensure Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (31 C.F.R. § 205.15(d) and</p>
<h2 id="2-cfr-200305b-requirements-are-met-the-amount-reported-on-line-10j-should">2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)) requirements are met, the amount reported on line 10j should</h2>
<p>be equal to or greater than the amount reported on 10i (required non-Federal share
amount) to ensure the portion of Federal funds expended for Supported Employment</p>
<p>services are being drawn down proportionally during the reporting period.</p>
<p>Non-Federal share can only be counted as match when obligated by September 30 of
the FFY of appropriation of an award. Unliquidated obligations reported in the fourth
quarter that are cancelled during the carryover period, or otherwise not liquidated
after the FFY of appropriation, may not be used toward satisfying the match
requirement for the FFY of appropriation for that particular award.</p>
<p>The grantee is responsible for ensuring that all fiscal data submitted, including
changes, are reflected in the State’s accounting system and consistent with the State’s

<p>10k. Remaining Recipient Share to Be Provided (10i minus 10j equals 10k):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.
If the amount is a positive number, this figure represents the required amount of non-</p>
<p>Federal share the grantee should have provided, but did not, to match the amount of
cash drawdowns (line 10a) through the end of the reporting period. If the amount is a
negative number, this figure represents the amount of non-Federal share provided that
exceeds the non-Federal share required to match the amount of Federal funds drawn
down (line 10a) through the end of the reporting period. The information provided on
this line will inform the grantee whether it is on track to satisfy its match requirement
by the end of the grant period. Grantees must ensure Federal funds are drawn down
proportionally in accordance with the CMIA (31 C.F.R. § 205.15(d) and 2 C.F.R.
§ 200.305(b)).</p>
<p>Note: The data in this field has no bearing on the requisite non-Federal share needed
by September 30 of the year of appropriation to fully match the authorized funds in
line 10d, or any unobligated balance of Federal funds the grantee intends to carry
over for obligation into the succeeding FFY. See instructions in line 10j.</p>

<p>10l. Total Federal Program Income Earned:
Enter the total amount of Federal program income (program income) earned and
received by the grantee as of the end of the reporting period. Program income is
considered earned in the FFY in which the funds are received by the grantee
(34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(1)). Program income means gross income received by the
grantee that is directly generated by an allowable activity supported under the
Supported Employment program (2 C.F.R. § 200.80). Do not include refunds or
rebates as program income.</p>
<h2 id="program-income-includes-social-security-administration-ssa-payments-that-the">Program income includes Social Security Administration (SSA) payments that the</h2>
<p>grantee has chosen to transfer from the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)
program to the Supported Employment program in accordance with regulations.
Program income from SSA payments recorded as received in the VR program that the</p>
<p>grantee has chosen to transfer to the Supported Employment program is restricted to
the grant award year that corresponds to the FFY in which it was earned in the VR
program. For example, SSA payments earned and recorded in the VR program in
FFY 2018 may be transferred to the Supported Employment program for expenditure
and reporting purposes under the FFY 2018 award. This means the transfer may occur
during the FFY 2018 grant year or, if applicable, during the FFY 2018 carryover year.</p>
<p>Include the amount of SSA payments recorded as received from the VR program
through a transfer in the total on line 10l and report the amount of transferred funds
separately on line 12c, Program Income Transferred from VR program.</p>
<p>Program income earned may only be expended in accordance with the addition
alternative.</p>
<p>10m. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Deduction Alternative:
Data entry is not required for this field. The deduction method is not an allowable</p>
<p>option for expending program income under the Supported Employment program in
accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(2). The addition method is the only
permissible use of program income under the Supported Employment program.</p>
<p>10n. Program Income Expended in Accordance with the Addition Alternative:
Enter the amount of program income that was used to supplement the Federal share of
the total program costs. The amount reported on line 10n represents actual
disbursements (i.e., outlays of program income by the grantee). The outlay of all
program income funds must meet the same standards of allowability, reasonableness
and allocability (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.403, 200.404 and 200.405) that are applicable to
Federal funds (Section 108 of the Rehabilitation Act and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.307(e)(2),
200.401, and 200.408).</p>
<p>10o. Unexpended Program Income (10l minus 10m or 10n equals 10o):
Data entry is not required for this field. This data element is calculated automatically.

<p>Note: “Program income earned or received during the fiscal year must be disbursed
during the period of performance of the award, prior to requesting additional cash
payments,” in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 363.24(b)(1).</p>
<h2 id="11-indirect-expense_1">11. Indirect Expense:</h2>
<p>Indirect costs are generally charged to Federal awards through an approved indirect cost rate
or cost allocation plan (CAP). Any State grantee that wishes to claim indirect costs under
Federal grants through an indirect cost rate must prepare an indirect cost proposal and
submit it to the cognizant Federal agency for approval (2 C.F.R. part 200 – Appendix VII,
paragraph D). State grantees claiming indirect expense based on a CAP, rather than an</p>
<p>indirect cost rate, must develop, document, maintain for audit, or submit, as appropriate, a
narrative cost allocation methodology for indirect costs to the cognizant agency for review,
negotiation, and approval, and must follow the directions included in the line item
instructions below (2 C.F.R. part 200 – Appendix VII, paragraph F.3).</p>
<p>11a. Type of Rate(s):
Select whether the approved indirect cost rate is Provisional, Predetermined, Final, or
Fixed. If based on an approved CAP, select CAP and proceed to line 12.</p>
<p>11b. Rate:
Enter the approved indirect cost rate(s) in effect during the reporting period.</p>
<p>11c. Period From; Period To:
